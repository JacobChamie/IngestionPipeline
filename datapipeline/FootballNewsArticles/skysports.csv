0,Euro 2024: Why England and Scotland are facing Germany travel challenge,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13070839/euro-2024-why-england-and-scotland-are-facing-germany-travel-challenge,Rob Dorsett,Publish time not found,"England could face a six-hour round trip by coach for one of their group games at Euro 2024 as UEFA tries to reduce air travel to make the tournament the most environmentally friendly ever. For Scotland, the journeys could be even longer with the distance between their first and second group games totalling more than 550 miles. However, whilst UEFA said last summer that it would be a ""requirement"" for all teams to travel by land for matches at the tournament, Sky Sports News has been told that there will now be a ""common sense"" approach taken, where no team will be banned from flying if the circumstances make that the most feasible option. Last summer, when UEFA and the German authorities laid out their strategy for the tournament, it was made clear that this would be the most environmentally friendly Euros finals ever. UEFA has designed the match schedules so that - in theory - there is less travelling for the teams, and for supporters. A ""Climate Fund"" has been created, where it is promised that for each tonne of CO2 emissions produced at EURO 2024, €25 will be donated to environmental projects. They predict that will mean around €7m (£6m) will be generated. UEFA's sponsors for the tournament are also more environmentally responsible than ever before. Whilst Gazprom were sponsors of Euro 2020, for example, there are no gas, oil or other utility companies in commercial partnership with UEFA this time. Instead, BYD are sponsoring the tournament, which is one of the biggest global developers of electric car technologies.

But the most controversial element of UEFA's plans surrounds travel during the tournament for both teams and supporters. Andreas Schar, managing director of Euro 2024, said last year: ""It is a very important part of our sustainability strategy: when the teams and fans travel, we would like them to do so by bus or train."" There will - deliberately - be fewer car parking spaces available near stadiums to try to deter car travel. Fans will be given discounts for rail and bus travel and there will be a free shuttle service for 36 hours before and after matches. However, there is an obvious flaw in UEFA's plans to ""cluster"" two of every nation's group games near each other. Schar said: ""This allows the teams to get to know the stadiums and gives the fans the opportunity to stay in the same area for two matches."" That strategy ignores the fact that a nation's training base may be large distances from the stadium so they will still have to travel back and forth. In England's case, their first game is against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen, their second against Denmark in Frankfurt and their final group game is against Slovenia in Cologne. All three venues are located in the West of Germany but England's training base is more than 250 miles away from all three, in East Germany. England's choice of base was determined by the quality of the facilities, its remote location away from big towns and supporters, and the distances to possible matches in the knockout stages too. In Scotland's case, the distances are even greater - though it's thought this has been skewed by the fact that Steve Clarke's side have the honour of kicking off the tournament in the showpiece opener against the hosts in Munich. Scotland's second game is 283 miles away from Munich, in Cologne. That is more than a six-hour drive or four-and-a-half hours by train. Two of Scotland's three group games are in stadiums relatively near to each other - Stuttgart and Munich are 144 miles apart - but those venues are for Scotland's first and third matches in Group A, with a potential 12-hour round trip to the North West of Germany for match two, in between. UEFA's mission is a laudable one: to try to reduce travel distances for teams and supporters, limit flights, reduce energy consumption, increase renewables and recycling, and improve sustainability across the whole tournament. However, the complex logistics for each nation taking part means that there will be no hard-and-fast rules applied, to how teams will be allowed to travel.

1,Chelsea 3-0 Everton: Guro Reiten scores two penalties in controversial Women's Super League victory,https://www.skysports.com/football/chelsea-women-vs-everton-women/report/494383,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Chelsea regained top spot in the Women's Super League thanks to two controversial penalties scored by Guro Reiten and a clinical finish from Erin Cuthbert in a 3-0 victory over Everton. Manchester City had temporarily moved above the Blues after beating Leicester earlier on Sunday, but Emma Hayes' side were ruthless as Mayra Ramirez made her first start since joining the club for a British-record fee of £385k. Everton were harshly undone in the first half when Clare Wheeler was punished for winning the ball ahead of Johanna Rytting Kaneryd in the penalty area. Reiten stepped up and found the bottom left corner beyond the reach of goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan. Then, with less than 20 minutes to play, Wheeler was again penalised after Ramirez went down in the box and Reiten made no mistake again. Everton manager Brian Sorensen was sent off for dissent moments before Cuthbert volleyed in the third to move Chelsea three points clear. Reiten had the first Chelsea chance from a smart Ramirez cross but was unable to beat Brosnan, who soon parried a delivery into the box against the upright with Wheeler clearing off the line. Wheeler was then punished for her good work in the Everton box as Reiten took full advantage from the penalty spot.

Sorensen showed his frustrations late on which were compounded by a lovely Chelsea move that Cuthbert rounded off with a clinical volley. Everton assistant manager Stephen Neligan told Sky Sports: ""Scoreline aside, there are lots of positives we can take from the performance. There are still a lot of things we can improve on. ""We came in at half-time and knew we had the wind behind us in the second half so were optimistic about what we could have got out of it. The first 15, 20 minutes of the second half we were happy and then the quality of Chelsea started to hurt some of our mistakes."" On penalty decisions: ""It's hard to see from where I was standing. I've seen the replay of the second one which could have gone either way. You could say both of them were hard done by but it is what it is.

I can't fault the players though, they want to win, they want to play well, I thought our quality did show through in the second half. ""Our issue in the first half was our impatience in possession that created the transitions between both teams, but yes, happy all around. ""We deserved to win the game. I have never seen us get two penalties in a game before, so that's a first! And a good debut for Mayra Ramirez."" On penalty decisions: ""I haven't watched it [the first one].

2,Roy Hodgson: Crystal Palace manager stable in hospital after being taken ill during training,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11706/13072364/roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-manager-stable-in-hospital-after-being-taken-ill-during-training,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson is in a stable condition and having tests in hospital after being taken ill during training on Thursday, the club have confirmed. The 76-year-old, who is the Premier League's oldest-ever manager, was due to speak at a scheduled press conference at 1.30pm on Thursday to preview Monday's Premier League game against Everton, but members of the media waiting outside the club's New Beckenham training ground were informed the briefing would not take place. According to Sky in Germany, Palace are set to sack Hodgson with ex-Eintracht Frankfurt boss Oliver Glasner lined up as his replacement. An update from the club later on Thursday read: ""Following news that Roy Hodgson was taken ill during today's training session, we can confirm that he is now stable and is currently undergoing tests in hospital. ""Everybody at the club sends their best wishes to Roy for a speedy recovery."" Palace sit 15th in the top flight, five points above the relegation zone, ahead of the upcoming clash with third-from-bottom Everton, live on Sky Sports. Hodgson took charge of his 200th match as Eagles manager on Monday when his side were beaten 3-1 at Selhurst Park by Chelsea. The former England boss is in his second spell in charge of the south London club, having returned for the final 10 games of last season when he signed a short-term deal to take over from the sacked Patrick Vieira. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He guided the club to an 11th-placed finish before agreeing to continue as manager for the 2023-24 campaign. Palace have won just six of 24 league fixtures this term, with only three of those victories coming since a 1-0 success at Manchester United in September. Disgruntled fans have displayed banners in recent weeks calling for Hodgson to be sacked and vented frustration with how the club is being run. Hodgson could be replaced by Austrian Glasner, who guided Frankfurt to Europa League glory in 2022 following a penalty shoot-out victory over Rangers in Seville. The 49-year-old, who has also managed Wolfsburg, has been out of work since leaving the Bundesliga side last summer.

We were set to speak to him at 1.30pm, that's despite intense speculation around his position at the club with many outlets reporting that he was set to be sacked. ""Then just a few minutes before 1pm yesterday afternoon we received a statement from Crystal Palace confirming that Hodgson was taken ill during the morning training session and would not be taking that press conference at 1.30pm. ""Then at 5pm, we got news that Hodgson was stable and undergoing tests in hospital. We are now awaiting more updates when it comes to Hodgson's health, but also to his position at the football club. ""It does appear that the leading candidate to come in if Crystal Palace are to make a managerial change is Oliver Glasner. ""Sky in Germany have reported he has agreed to join Crystal Palace, but if he is to step in now then he will need to hit the ground running because Crystal Palace have got three really difficult and important games in the relegation fight.""

4,"Oscar Bobb's Man City rise: From Norway to Manchester, the making of Pep Guardiola's precocious new superstar",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/13059879/oscar-bobbs-man-city-rise-from-norway-to-manchester-the-making-of-pep-guardiolas-precocious-new-superstar,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"Cole Palmer will feel that he has justified his decision to leave Manchester City for Chelsea given his impact at Stamford Bridge but as he returns to the Etihad Stadium there is satisfaction that Oscar Bobb has seized the opportunity to take his place. The 20-year-old Norwegian winger has already played more Premier League minutes than Palmer managed to accrue last season and has made a bigger impact too. His match-winning goal against Newcastle could prove to be a key moment in the title race. Kevin De Bruyne took the headlines for his perfect pass that day but he was careful to credit his young colleague. ""If he does not run then I cannot pass the ball so he dictates what I can do."" The goal made the assist just as much as the assist made the goal. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The very fact that Bobb was on the pitch at such a crucial stage of the game reveals the trust that City have in him. Pep Guardiola turned to him ahead of Jack Grealish at St James' Park. He was in search of a goal rather than control and Bobb delivered for him. It reflects the player's growing stature within the group. His team-mates believe in him. ""That is more important than the manager,"" says Guardiola. ""When the team-mates can say that a player can play with us that is the best success - and it was immediate."" Guardiola talks of how Bobb can play in five different positions and of his hopes that City have found a player who can be a big part of the team for many years to come. ""He is so dynamic. His work ethic is unbelievable. He does not feel the pressure much."" Over in Norway, there is pride and satisfaction because Bobb's journey to this point began long before he started making such an impression within City's famed academy. This is a young man whose talent was identified at the age of just seven years old. Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports with NOW Download the Sky Sports app Football features on Sky That appetite to impress and the mentality to handle difficult situations, as well as his technique and the tactical flexibility, all of it was being worked on during his time with Fotballprogresjon Norge. For six years, a formative time in his development, Bobb was with FPN - an organisation specialising in personal training. Danny Sannes, the founder, and Kim-David Hunstok, the sporting director, have helped to build FPN into Norway's leading development school. The pair work hand in glove - so much so that they prefer to be quoted together rather than individually. Ironic given that their work is all about the individual. ""You cannot compare,"" they tell Sky Sports when asked how their training differs to that offered by clubs. ""What sets us apart is that our approach resembles a structured form of individual training. While the club focuses primarily on team development, we dedicate our time to the development of individual players. We firmly believe that our work is crucial."" ""In traditional clubs, it is challenging for a coach to provide personal attention to each player. For those aspiring to become professional football players, extra training outside their club environment becomes very important. Our mission is to develop that talent."" Bobb has become a poster boy for their work, having been at FPN from the age of seven to 13. ""We have many precious memories of Oscar. He was a very dedicated boy who loved to train. He was easy to work with, cheerful, smiling and polite, always eager to learn."" They recall his first day. ""The legendary first session!"" Maintaining focus was not easy. He was seven, after all. ""He was more interested in what was happening around us."" But once they were able to put together a small group of young talents, that changed. Mathias Emilsen, Mats Aaserud and Elias Aarflot joined too. ""We got three new little bundles of energy and training became a kind of superhero gathering for football-loving kids. Great memories."" All three are now pursuing professional careers of their own. Bobb's ability to take in new information so quickly - essential now working with Guardiola - soon became a key feature of what made him so special. ""Having an individual meeting with him at the age of eight or nine was almost like conversing with an adult."" Technically, he was outstanding from the outset. ""When it came to exercises that combined coordination, technique and tactics, you could see the sparkle in his eyes, and you could see that he had something entirely different to the rest - something special."" Bobb would ""dominate the one-on-one sessions with his incredible touch"" and ""establish the benchmark for boys born in 2003 in Oslo and later throughout the entire country."" But as Guardiola was just as keen to highlight, his rise is about his will as well as his skill. ""We also remember days when Oscar would be on the field before school started in the morning. Just him and a ball and a few cones. Individual training with quality. While others were still rolling around in bed, Oscar was working on improving his skills."" It is remarkable how thorough their coaching vision is when working with such young players. ""We integrate tactical aspects,"" they explain. ""Our training is not isolated to technical skills. Football understanding is a crucial element in our approach."" They coach players to think quickly. ""We used coloured cards, each indicating different instructions, stimulating players to make quick and accurate decisions based on what they see. In recent years, we have incorporated various light systems as well."" Children as young as six are being given an insight into the mental aspects of being a footballer. ""When the challenging days arrive, they have a lot of mental skills to solve many of the problems. We strongly believe that this positively shapes their development. ""Our goal is to develop mentally strong players with a mindset of courage. We want players to take risks, dribble, try difficult passes. And when a player does a mistake, we work on their reaction, focusing on the upcoming task rather that dwelling on the past."" And they try to remember to make it fun. ""We want a positive atmosphere in training. Negative comments or negative body language are not allowed. Everyone should leave training with a smile, with the feeling that they have been seen and coached."" As many as 60 players are making that next step from FPN to a career in professional football and there is excitement about the progress of a number of them. Players at Atalanta and Anderlecht, at PSV, Heerenveen and Twente are among those mentioned. The model works. ""It is becoming more and more challenging to break through on your own. Very few players will train effectively independently. Discipline and proper expertise are essential. Otherwise, there is a risk of doing incorrect training,"" they explain. ""The game is evolving at high speed and to stay ahead we need to be somewhat ahead of the curve. The small details and percentages are becoming increasingly crucial for success and personal coaching services are sure to play a more significant role in the future."" But one young man stands out above the rest. In September, Bobb made his Premier League debut. A senior international debut followed in October and his first goal for Norway came in November. The month of December saw him play in City's Club World Cup final win. January brought that goal at Newcastle. ""Oscar's goal was amazing. Absolutely magical. The first touch, the control, and the instinctive finish, these are elements we recognise from the time he trained with us on a weekly basis. The intelligence of his movement without the ball is remarkable."" ""It is satisfying to witness these skills translate to such breathtaking moments at the highest level of football. Our joy is primarily for him but it means a great deal to us too. It will be really interesting to see Oscar playing more regularly alongside De Bruyne.""

5,Phil Brown interview: Lifting Kidderminster Harriers from 'absolute oblivion' with four wins in a row,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/13066534/phil-brown-interview-lifting-kidderminster-harriers-from-absolute-oblivion-with-four-wins-in-a-row,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"When Phil Brown arrived at Kidderminster Harriers in January, the situation was bleak. Defeat to Rochdale had left the club not just bottom of the National League but seven points from safety. What has happened since has been remarkable. Brown has guided Kidderminster to four wins from his four games in charge. It is as many as they had won all season. Improbably, though still in the relegation zone, they are now just seven points away from the top half of the table. Belief has been restored. ""We were so far adrift that people were already saying we were dead and buried,"" Brown tells Sky Sports. ""The players were staring at a league table telling them they were rock bottom and needing snookers to get out of it. But I am a decent snooker player."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He laughs. It is a nice line, delivered with that familiar twinkle. Brown has operated higher than this, of course. But the man who once took Hull City to the Premier League and then kept them up in the club's first-ever top-flight season, is revelling in this new role. Now 64 and having been to work in India and back since his Hull days, he was last seen helping to keep Barrow in the Football League last year. ""We had nine games to go and the target was a bit clearer because we were closer to the end of the season."" The task at Kidderminster looked more daunting, the turnaround required more drastic. What persuaded him to take on this apparently hopeless case? ""I was looking for a good club with good people that had a cause. I think I found that,"" he explains. ""To be honest with you, I also looked at their results so far this season. I was absolutely amazed and flabbergasted by the number of games in which Kidderminster had been either in the lead late on and drew or were level in and lost those games late on. Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Download the Sky Sports app ""One goal or one moment had been the difference. I looked at those results and thought to myself that if I could just turn the corner in one or two games and prove to the players that if they did certain things and did it successfully, there would be an opportunity here."" And so it has proved. His two away games have been won 1-0. The home fixtures have been more dramatic. Twice Kidderminster have fallen two goals behind. Twice they have conjured up astonishing comebacks to take all three points. Aggborough is rocking again. The win over Oxford City last time out provided Brown's personal highlight of his time at Kidderminster so far. He was sent off. Not an obvious choice for his favourite experience but it was what happened next that has stayed with him in the days since. ""I was in the changing room watching the game with my wife, my daughter and my son. When the third goal went in, having only been involved with Kidderminster for three or four weeks, my wife Jade went absolutely ballistic. Nobody saw it apart from us. ""Nobody can ever question the commitment of the Browns because I witnessed my wife running around in the changing room because we had got the third goal. If my wife is in it 100 per cent, I can only afford to be in it 100 per cent as well."" The man who has registered Premier League wins over Arsene Wenger as well as England bosses past and present clearly still gets a kick out of this game. ""There is nothing better than standing on that touchline trying to plot the downfall of the opposition."" But how has he turned it all around? He is careful to credit predecessor Russell Penn. ""I thank him for building a group that works hard. That was in place."" He watched caretaker Jimmy O'Connor oversee a penalty shootout win in the FA Trophy. ""There was something to work with,"" he adds. ""I learned one word during my time in India and that was imandari - and that meant honesty. If you get a group of honest players working for you it is a wonderful feeling. Win, lose or draw, as a manager, you can hold your hands up and you can be happy."" The team desperately needed a new voice and Brown tried to connect quickly. ""That is what I did on the first day. I opened up to them. They might have thought I was a 'madman' because I was telling them one or two stories that will remain in house."" Brown has plenty of stories. There are those from his days as assistant to Sam Allardyce at Bolton Wanderers. The club finished sixth in the Premier League in his final season there, assembling an entertaining group to great effect. There was the time that the kitman stuck Ricardo Gardner at left-back on the whiteboard and Allardyce liked the idea so much that he played him there for years. Or the one about their cutting-edge headsets having an open line that picked up the local pizza orders. They are the tales of after-dinner speeches but the truth is that Allardyce and Brown were ahead of their time. Their superior understanding of the transfer market and the club's fledgling performance analysis helped Bolton to consistently overachieve. ""We were fighting against the odds,"" says Brown. ""Particularly that period from 1999 to 2001 in the Premier League when we had the smallest budget, the smallest squad, the worst group of players by most people's reckoning. But we had this way of playing."" The style question is something that Allardyce has had to defend for years. Brown has his own explanation. ""It was discredited with those two words 'long ball' but it was all about what happened after the long ball. What happened was the second ball,"" he says. ""Everyone talks about regains and transitions now. It is winning the second ball, basically. Win enough of them and if you have decent players, you will hurt anyone. That is what we did at Bolton. We won that second ball and we were in their half and hurting people."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  At Kidderminster, he is assisted by Neil McDonald, who was on that staff at Bolton. They are still trying to find an edge. ""We have rules in place. When you tick those boxes, it can be a winning formula. And he has a group of players who are buying into it,"" he says. ""It is difficult to stick to your beliefs. My advice to any young coach would be to stay true to yourself. It is so important because when you try to be someone else and you do not really believe it, and you look into the whites of the eyes of your players, they will see it."" They are believers at Aggborough now. And yet, when they were still bottom of the table after winning that first game against Aldershot, it only underlined how desperate the situation had become. When the second win was followed by a third, they were able to catch one of the teams above them. ""But then you go four wins on the bounce and all of a sudden you have caught three. That is purely down to everybody singing from the same hymn sheet. Nobody veers off. If they do, they might find themselves sitting beside me, no matter who they are."" Brown still has a way with words. ""If you have the opposition's respect, do not disappoint them."" But his team are backing it up with their actions. He is happy but cautious. ""If anyone thinks they have cracked this game, it does not half know how to bite you,"" he adds. ""We are not there by any stretch of the imagination but we are going in the right direction. There is a lot of work to do. We have to finish the job. We were brought in to stay in the division. We are nowhere near that, we have just had a good start."" Even so, this is the most astonishing turnaround in English football right now. For a manager who has won promotion to the Premier League, coached at the highest level, where would keeping this club in the country's fifth tier rank on his list of accomplishments? ""If Kidderminster Harriers are a National League club next season, I can say, categorically, that would be one of the highlights of my career. Taking a club from absolute oblivion to survival would be a great achievement,"" he says. ""But there is a long way to go."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

8,Southampton 5-3 Huddersfield Town: Russell Martin's Saints score five second-half goals to preserve long unbeaten run,https://www.skysports.com/football/soton-vs-huddsfld/report/485071,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Joe Rothwell's spectacular double saw Southampton recover from 2-0 down to beat Huddersfield 5-3 in a Sky Bet Championship thriller at St Mary's. Saints were seeing their record 24-game unbeaten run dissolve in front of their eyes when goals from Sorba Thomas and David Kasumu left relegation-battling Huddersfield in charge at the break. Rothewell's brilliant brace levelled things up soon after half-time but Town reclaimed the lead in the 65th minute through Alex Matos. However, a Tom Lees own goal in the 80th minute saw parity restored and Saints would go on to claim the points thanks to late strikes Sekou Mara and Samuel Edozie, ensuring they remain second in the table. Jon Worthington's spell as caretaker manager of Huddersfield had started with a 4-0 victory over fellow strugglers Sheffield Wednesday and the confidence from that victory was clear. A variety of early half-chances came and went but Flynn Downes' exit in the 32nd minute while clutching his groin allowed the Terriers to pounce, as Saints were forced to rejig their midfield. Jack Rudoni pulled back the ball from the left to an unmarked Thomas who cleverly bounced his low finish over Ryan Manning's leg to put the visitors 1-0 up in the 36th minute. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp It was the first time Southampton had been behind at home in almost 22 hours and only the second goal they had conceded at St Mary's in three months. Nine minutes later they had conceded a second. This time Thomas turned provider with a run and cross from the right which wing-back Kasumu crashed into the roof of the net. Kasumu had played under Southampton boss Russell Martin at MK Dons and this was his first Huddersfield goal on his 50th appearance. The home side's performance, tied in with an unhappiness towards referee David Webb, saw loud boos accompany the half-time whistle. But four minutes after the re-start, Saints got themselves back into the game in style when Rothwell smashed an unstoppable volley into the top corner after Lee Nicholls had punched Stuart Armstrong's corner to the edge of the box. It was Rothwell's first goal since arriving on loan from Bournemouth last month. He only had to wait another 65 seconds for his second. This time his former Cherries team-mate, and fellow substitute, David Brooks found his run into the box with a clever reverse pass before Rothwell finished with aplomb over Nicholls. The Saints fans were deafening in their celebrations and were ready to take the roof off when Adam Armstrong was sent clean through but elected to attempt a chip that was claimed by a grateful Nicholls. Huddersfield then found a second wind and they capitalised when Matos stepped onto his right foot and fired the visitors back in front, his shot deflecting up off Will Smallbone and over the despairing Gavin Bazunu. But Saints continued their club record unbeaten run in style with two goals in the space of four minutes to go 4-3 ahead. They levelled things when Rothwell's low ball from the left was turned into his own net by Lees before Mara put the hosts in front for the first time after Brooks had cut back to him. Another substitute, Edozie, capped things off in stoppage time after Mara had held off three defenders to tee him up as Saints kept their noses just ahead of Leeds. Southampton's Russell Martin: ""I enjoyed the feeling at the end. That isn't my kind of game. It was like basketball at one point, it was carnage. I love basketball but not on a big pitch. ""My immediate feeling is immense pride and gratitude towards the players and the supporters for the energy they showed. ""The conversation we had at half-time was about how it is never easy to play the way we want to play. ""To do what they are doing is incredible. Nobody should ever take that for granted. It takes immense work, courage and intensity. We lacked all of that in the first half. ""Then, to bring it back to 2-2, what a response. Then we got caught up in that emotion. To go 3-2 down and deal with that setback was incredible. ""I'm frustrated at the first half. I'm frustrated that we have conceded as many goals today as we have in our last 10 home games. ""But big credit to Huddersfield, I thought they were great. They came here with complete freedom. They deserved to be leading at half time, but we deserved to win it by the end of the game. ""We will take a lot from that second half, but we will also learn a lot from the first half. The gaps were too big and we lacked courage because what Huddersfield were doing to us. ""We got spooked for the first time in a long time. To overcome that in the way that we did was immense. I am so proud of them."" Huddersfield caretaker Jon Worthington: ""I enjoyed the game. The lads gave everything I asked of them and followed the plan to a tee. There are loads of positives especially as a coach and from the way we played. ""I'm really proud. I believe in this group of players and they have trust in me and the staff to follow the game plan. ""We are disappointed with the result. I want to win games, and hate losing and so do the players. ""Loved the performance and the front four and that is how I think it should be played. At 2-0 up we didn't want to sit back because that would be what Southampton wanted.""

9,Dan Ashworth: Manchester United planning formal approach to Newcastle for sporting director,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13071448/dan-ashworth-manchester-united-planning-formal-approach-to-newcastle-for-sporting-director,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth has been approached by Manchester United. It is understood the Magpies chief is top of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's list to front up his new football operation at Old Trafford, although there is yet to be formal contact between the two clubs. It's understood Ashworth is open to the move and Newcastle would be looking for significant compensation, given he only joined the club two years ago. Man Utd would ideally want him in place this summer to oversee their transfer overhaul as INEOS take control over the football operation. The interest in Ashworth comes after the Premier League and the Football Association both approved Ratcliffe's proposed bid to buy a minority stake in the club. Man Utd are now expecting clearance from the FA as British billionaire Ratcliffe, who is the owner of multinational chemicals company INEOS, closes in on completion of his deal to buy 25 per cent of the club. Ratcliffe agreed a deal in December to buy a stake worth roughly £1.2bn and has been conducting a series of meetings with club staff and associates in recent days. Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Download the Sky Sports app Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A potential move for Ashworth follows the appointment of Omar Berrada from rivals Manchester City as the club's new chief executive. Sky Sports News understands the appointment was made by Ratcliffe in consultation with Joel and Avram Glazer but INEOS were the driving force behind the move. The deal was done quickly so Berrada can be in place as soon as possible after Ratcliffe's deal to buy 25 per cent of Man Utd has been completed. Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: ""It is very significant because Jim Ratcliffe is not wasting any time at Manchester United. He's already brought in Sir Dave Brailsford, who's conducting a review of the whole club. He's already appointed Omar Berrada as a new chief executive who used to have a senior role at Manchester City. ""But the key role that fans want filled is this sporting director role because it is no secret in football that Manchester United haven't been performing very well in the transfer market and Dan Ashworth is somebody who has an absolutely brilliant record at West Brom, Brighton and also at Newcastle. ""He also did exceptional work when he was at the Football Association, bringing through a whole new young England team while working very closely with Gareth Southgate. ""He's got a reputation as being the best in the business as far as English football is concerned, and I think it would be a big coup if Manchester United were able to get him from Newcastle. ""Sometimes when it comes to transfers, you can overstate how much one person is responsible for making those signings, so I don't know if Dan Ashworth was responsible for signing Moises Caicedo at Brighton for £4.5m, Kaoru Mitoma for £2.5m and Alexis MacAllister for around £6m. ""At Newcastle, Bruno Guimaraes, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon - they've made some really good signings. I'm not saying that's all down to Dan Ashworth, but he has been the man in charge, he's been the sporting director, so you have to say when you look at his CV, when you look at his track record and compare it to what has been a real hit and miss sort of recruitment operation at Manchester United recently, you would have to say this is a very positive move if it comes off. ""I've had some dealings with him, especially when he used to work at the Football Association. He's a very impressive character. He knows English football inside out and I think he's also very plugged into the best young English players so maybe we could see United buying them and young players from abroad."" Analysis by Sky Sports News North East reporter Keith Downie: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""You have to remember that although he was appointed in February 2022, the first four or five months of that was spent on gardening leave, so he only really got his feet under the desk at Newcastle in June 2022. ""So he is less than two years into what is a huge rebuilding job at Newcastle, but you would suggest the rebuilding job is even bigger at Man Utd. ""As far as Newcastle is concerned, they would be very reluctant to lose him, he is a huge part of what they are trying to do right now. But like with a player transfer, if an individual agitates to leave and their head is turned, it may be difficult for Newcastle to hold on to him. ""The last thing they would want to do is drag this out. Remember, Dan Ashworth is privy to lots of sensitive transfer information and the noises coming out of the club are that they want this dealt with quickly, they do not want this to drag on. ""But they are now well aware that Man Utd are keen on bringing Ashworth in and they are braced for that formal approach to come, but they will not let Ashworth go without a fight, they will be looking for compensation and it may be that he will have to serve a period of gardening leave like we saw when he joined Newcastle from Brighton as well. ""For Newcastle, it would not be great in terms of optics losing someone of his stature to Man Utd, but sometimes these decisions are out of the hands of the powers that be at football clubs.""

10,"Luton Town: How Ross Barkley, Elijah Adebayo and Rob Edwards' style of play are reaping success",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11717/13066012/luton-town-how-ross-barkley-elijah-adebayo-and-rob-edwards-style-of-play-are-reaping-success,Karl Sturgeon,Publish time not found,"Luton have repeatedly defied gravity during their decade-long odyssey back to the top of English football - but how are they doing it again? A club who have spent about £30m over the last 30 years are a point behind Nottingham Forest, who spent £30m on Ibrahim Sangare alone earlier this season. The form table also suggests Luton are getting better. Since the pre-Christmas weekend of December 22-24, they have taken more points than Arsenal. Rob Edwards and his team still have a lot of work to do if they are to stay in the Premier League, but their fate is in their own hands and they have adapted better than their fellow promoted teams: Luton have 20 points, almost as many as Burnley (13) and Sheffield United (10) combined. Luton know what they are good at - they are direct. That always seems like a loaded term in English football, conjuring up images of route-one mudbaths from decades long past, but, when it works, it is as valid and effective as any other type of football. Luton make it work. In total, around eight per cent of Luton's passes this season have been sent into the opponent's box - the only team with a higher proportion are Everton, managed by Sean Dyche, the Premier League's biggest proponent of direct football over recent years. This sounds like it is veering into 1980s percentage football, get-it-into-the-mixer cliche, but Luton do it because that is where they are a threat: this season they have scored a goal for every 15.8 touches they have in the opponent's box. Only Newcastle and Wolves are more efficient. Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Tellingly, Burnley and Sheffield United are the teams who require the most touches in the box to score. Elijah Adebayo might sum up Luton better than any other player. He joined Fulham at U9 level but never made a senior appearance, dropping down as low as the seventh tier in loan spells at Slough Town and Bognor Regis. Just like Luton, he has adapted to the Premier League well. The former Cheltenham, Swindon, Stevenage and Walsall forward has the best shot conversion rate of any player to take 10 or more shots in the Premier League this season - better than Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Heung-Min Son and any of the league's other superstars. Adebayo has nine league goals this season, including strikes against Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle. He embodies the Luton ethos of being effective and unpretentious: 23 of his 24 shots in the Premier League have come from inside the box. He takes his shots from an average of 9.3 yards out, closer to goal than any non-defender whose shots come predominantly from set-piece situations. His Premier League goal map demonstrates this perfectly. Luton get it into the box and Adebayo does the rest. At the start of August, Ross Barkley was without a club and three months short of his 30th birthday. He never quite established himself in five seasons at Chelsea, and indifferent spells with Aston Villa and Nice did not rekindle his career. The former England midfielder was in danger of becoming a forgotten man, but, luckily for him, Luton specialise in players with a point to prove. Barkley offers Luton his Premier League know-how and quality in possession: he is Luton's main man for ball progression, leading in both passes and ball-carries that get the team closer to goal. The Hatters might not obsess over possession, but Edwards recognises the value of having a player in midfield who can get the ball upfield and take pressure off. Barkley's role in Luton's goal against Liverpool in November illustrates this perfectly: after a Liverpool corner breaks down he beats a man on the edge of his own penalty area, brings the ball forward, and plays a progressive pass into Issa Kabore, who crosses for Tahith Chong to score. Luton have scored within 10 seconds of Barkley touching the ball If you compare Barkley's form this season to his Premier League career as a whole, two things stand out. His chance creation and dribbling have been almost identical to that of previous years, when he tended to play for top-half teams who attacked more than they defended. But Barkley has also improved the defensive side of his game, roughly doubling both his tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes. He brings top-half attacking output without being a luxury player. He has bought into the Luton ethos. Of course, Luton are still up against it. They are a point outside the relegation zone and only above the dotted line because of Everton's points deduction. They still have to go to Anfield, the Emirates and the Etihad. But hardly anyone has had a comfortable afternoon against them this season, and they know exactly how to make the most of what they have got. You would be brave to bet against them defying gravity once again.

12,Could Profit and Sustainability rules be about to change? Premier League clubs set to discuss this week,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/13065512/could-profit-and-sustainability-rules-be-about-to-change-premier-league-clubs-set-to-discuss-this-week,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Premier League clubs are meeting later this week to discuss replacing Profit and Sustainability Rules with new financial fair play regulations. The present Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules limit clubs to losses of £105m over a three-year period. Under new proposals being discussed the Premier League would have new rules which would instead align with UEFA's squad cost ratio system. In that system, UEFA limits clubs to spending 70 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - transfers, wages and agents' fees. Premier League clubs could adopt a similar approach which would see clubs limited to spending 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs. Everton are expected to find out by the end of next week the result of their appeal over their 10-point deduction for breaking PSR rules.


An independent commission hearing into Everton being charged with breaking the rules for a second time must then be completed by April 7.


Nottingham Forest will also appear before a separate independent commission before April 7 after they were charged with breaking financial rules in their 2022/23 accounts. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: Under UEFA's rules, if your turnover is £500m per year, you would be allowed to spend 70 per cent of that - £350m per year - on player costs. Everton and Nottingham Forest charged with breaching Premier League PSR regulationsules PSR explained: What limits clubs spending more? Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW It's interesting because if you're one of the bigger clubs with a big turnover, you'll be able to spend a lot more money on players and transfers than some of the smaller clubs. So every weekend, we're going to see games between clubs who have spent £500m on players against clubs who have spent only £150m. We have that situation already because we have clubs who spend more on players and wages than some of the so-called smaller clubs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Critics will say this stops someone like a Roman Abramovich coming into Luton and saying 'I'm going to turbo-charge Luton and turn them into Man City or Chelsea by spending lots of money on players and wages'. That simply won't be allowed because if you're the new owner of Luton, you'll have to stick to this limit. It is going to be controversial, but I don't think it'll be decided this week. It's going to be discussed at this meeting but there won't be a vote during the two-day meeting, which starts on Thursday, but it's definitely a direction we're travelling in. Clubs who already play in Europe abide by these rules anyway because they're UEFA rules, so it makes sense for the Premier League to mirror that. All Premier League clubs have a say and there will be a range of views. Fourteen Premier League clubs will have to vote for it to be carried. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In the simplest terms, when every Premier League team tots up their annual accounts, they can have made a loss no greater than £105m across the previous three seasons. Clubs can only lose £15m of their own money across those three years. So that's no more than £15m extra on outgoings like transfer fees, player wages and, in a lot of clubs' cases, paying off former managers compared to their income from TV payments, season tickets, selling players and so on. The other £90m of any £105m must be guaranteed by their owners buying up shares, known as 'secure funding', and essentially means bankrolling the club.

The winger struck in the fifth minute as the Tigers secured a second consecutive win. The victory moved Hull, who handed starts to January signings Ryan Giles and Anass Zaroury, into sixth spot, one point above Coventry. Millwall have now taken just a point from their last four games, with just two goals in that time. They are five points off the relegation places. Fabio Carvalho, the youngster on loan from Liverpool, went close to adding a second goal as Hull dominated the first 45 minutes. Joe Edwards sent forward Tom Bradshaw on for Millwall at half-time and the visitors threatened in the second half but struggled to many quality opportunities. They could have equalised when Zian Flemming's bold attempt to lob Hull goalkeeper Ryan Allsop landed on the goal, which was their final genuine chance to nick a point.

""Some of our football in the first half was excellent and it's great to be able to say we can improve after winning a game of football. ""In terms of the first-half performance, other than really having teeth and finishing off Millwall, there were some really good signs - for Anass, his first game, Ryan Giles, his debut, and Jaden's first game back in two months. ""I wanted the second goal because I felt our energy levels would tail off naturally. ""Overall, delighted to win the game and a lot of positive signs in the way we want to play - the understanding, the connection between the players."" Millwall's Joe Edwards: ""Very much a game of two halves in terms of our performance. We didn't play well in the first half. ""They get a dream start after four minutes, albeit a sloppy error from us around the box, but someone hits an absolute rocket against the bar and it rebounds to their player and he finishes really well. ""They really grew in confidence and they are a team that loves to drift around the pitch and play good possession. ""They are a good footballing team. That is why they are up that end of the division, and we respect that. ""But we had our moments to take the sting out the game, as we have done in other games in recent weeks, but we didn't do it and we were a bit sloppy.

The Egyptian returned early from the Africa Cup of Nations with a hamstring injury but now looks set to play again for the Reds for the first time since scoring twice against Newcastle on New Year's Day. ""Mo is back in full training that brings him automatically into contention, of course,"" said Klopp about his leading scorer, who has 14 goals and eight assists in the Premier League this season. There was more positive team news for Liverpool, with Ibrahima Konate back from suspension, Joe Gomez fit again and Alisson recovered from an illness. Conor Bradley also returns to the squad following the death of his father. However, Thiago Alcantara and Trent Alexander-Arnold remain out. Earlier this week it was confirmed Alexander-Arnold would not be back in time from his knee problem to play for Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on February 25 and Klopp says he is also doubtful Dominik Szoboszlai will be back from his thigh injury for that Wembley fixture. ""I'm not sure Dom has a chance for the final but maybe,"" said the Liverpool boss.

20,Rodri: Man City midfielder has not lost for a year in Pep Guardiola's team - so why is he so important?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13066088/rodri-man-city-midfielder-has-not-lost-for-a-year-in-pep-guardiolas-team-so-why-is-he-so-important,Sam Blitz,Publish time not found,"Fifty-two matches played in 52 weeks – zero defeats. An unbeaten year for Rodri in Manchester City colours. Ever since Tottenham beat Pep Guardiola's side 1-0 on February 5, Rodri has guided his club to historic success. Five trophies, 42 wins and 10 draws later, plus one Champions League final-winning goal - perhaps the Spain midfielder has forgotten how to lose. In fact, for both club and country, the only two disappointments Rodri has experienced in the last year are a penalty shootout loss to Arsenal in the Community Shield - which technically counts as a draw in 90 minutes - and Scotland's 2-0 shock win over Spain back last March. The drop-off City show when Rodri is not there is telling. Guardiola's winning machine have lost five out of the seven matches the 27-year-old has missed over the past year. They have shown they can cope without Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne, but no Rodri? It's just not the same. If Guardiola is the conductor in this perfectly tuned City orchestra, then Rodri is the metronome that sets the rhythm. The treble winners are the pass masters of Europe and at the heart of the team is Rodri, who is involved in more sequences of play than any other player on the pitch. It is not just the number of passes that Rodri makes, it is the type of balls he plays. The 27-year-old plays more passes between the lines, and bypassed more defenders through doing so, than any other player in the division. Man City fixtures Latest Man City news Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Download the Sky Sports App It does not just make him a good build-up player, he is also a creative threat. No better statistic sums it up better than Rodri being in the top-10 players in the division for passes that lead to a shot within two passes - the other nine are either attacking midfielders, wingers or strikers. An example of how effective Rodri is in this aspect was City's third goal against Brentford on Monday Night Football. The Spain midfielder took four Brentford defenders out of the game to feed Erling Haaland, who then had the space to tee up Phil Foden for his hat-trick. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Other standout moments include unlocking Nottingham Forest's defence with a crossfield pass to tee up another Foden goal in September. He repeated the same action at Manchester United a few weeks later, only this time Foden and Haaland could not get past Andre Onana. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The stats metrics show this too - Rodri ranks third for accurate switches of play in the Premier League this season, showing he can produce the unpredictable alongside the rhythmic steadiness in this City team. Of course, Rodri also has a defensive element to his game. Even though City dominate possession regularly and do far less defending compared to most teams, Rodri still ranks second in the Premier League for balls won in the middle third of the pitch. That is to be expected as he is one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, but what is not is his goal threat, with 10 goals and 14 assists in all competitions since the start of last season. His goals are not just standard stat-padding ones either. Aside from the Champions League final winner in Istanbul, there was the late winner at Sheffield United, an important piledriver at Chelsea and a stunning effort in the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich. But Rodri is not just City's man for the moment. He's their man for every moment, as where would they be without him?

21,Bournemouth 1-1 Nottingham Forest: Callum Hudson-Odoi strike earns valuable point for relegation-threatened Reds,https://www.skysports.com/football/bmouth-vs-n-forest/report/482812,Dan Long,Publish time not found,"Nottingham Forest earned an important point but remain in the thick of the Premier League relegation battle after a 1-1 draw against Bournemouth on Sunday. Justin Kluivert prodded in his third league goal of the season inside five minutes at the Vitality Stadium, which put the Cherries on course for their first league win since Boxing Day. However, they had dropped 15 points from winning positions throughout the season already and Forest exploited their knack of failing to hold onto a lead by equalising through a lovely curling finish from Callum Hudson-Odoi in first-half stoppage time. Bournemouth were reduced to 10 players late on, when substitute Philip Billing was shown a straight red card for raking his studs down the back of Hudson-Odoi's right Achilles, but, ultimately, it did not affect the result. The hosts climb up a place to 12th due to their second draw in succession, while Forest move above Luton into 16th, two points above Everton, who occupy the final spot in the bottom three at present. Bournemouth:  Neto (7), Smith (6), Zabarnyi (6), Senesi (6), Kelly (6), Cook (7), Christie (6), Semenyo (5), Kluivert (7), Sinisterra (7), Solanke (5).


Subs:  Tavernier (5), Scott (5), Billing (4), Outtara (5), Kerkez (n/a).


Nottingham Forest:  Sels (6), Williams (6), Omobamidele (6), Murillo (7), Tavares (6), Yates (7), Dominguez (6), Elanga (6), Gibbs-White (5), Hudson-Odoi (7), Awoniyi (6).


Subs:  Danilo (5), Reyna (5), Montiel (5), Ribeiro (n/a). With Saturday's results having seen Forest drop to 17th in the Premier League table, picking up points on the south coast took on extra significance. A defeat would deepen their increasing relegation fears. So it was far from ideal when they fell behind inside five minutes. Lewis Cook's wicked corner delivery from the left was met by Luis Sinisterra, before taking a deflection to the back post, where Kluivert was well-placed to apply the final touch on the line and deny Deadline Day signing Matz Sels a debut clean sheet. How Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest lined up Match stats Live Premier League table Download the Sky Sports App In truth, quality chances came at a premium for the rest of the half, except, perhaps, the two low efforts Ryan Yates slammed straight at Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto. But there was one just before the break that levelled the game. Hudson-Odoi won a 50/50 against Ryan Christie, kept his balance and curled a beauty out of the reach of the Cherries goalkeeper and into the back of the net. Forest had grown into the game by then and it was no less than they deserved. It seemed, initially, that the equaliser had given Forest a spring in their step after the break, but the game soon reverted back to a pretty open, yet unremarkable, affair. There was time for one moment of drama towards the end, when Billing caught Hudson-Odoi with a nasty challenge that ended his afternoon after less than half an hour. But in the seven minutes of stoppage time that followed, no winner could be found. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola: ""It was a game where there was not a lot of space for both teams. I think they had more energy than us, that's the reason I made the subs very, very early to try to match their physical condition. We dealt well with the game, we finished with 10 and didn't concede clear chances. ""Today, we didn't have the legs. We started very well in the first 20-25 minutes, but once we burned some energy, we couldn't keep this level and it cost us much, much more."" On Billing's red card: ""I think he goes to make the foul to stop the counter. It's true that he goes from behind, but his foot is touching the floor. There's nothing dangerous, he just steps on him. ""For me, it's too harsh to be a red card. Nobody thought [when it was] live that it was going to be a red, but I think we did quite well with 10."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Nottingham Forest's Nuno Espirito Santo: ""What cost us was to concede so soon in the game; it's something we should avoid. In the first half, we reacted and I think we played really well; we started to dominate and create problems for Bournemouth. In the second half, for both teams, it was not a well-played game. ""Confidence is the foundation of playing football. The players must have confidence and we are insisting on that because we must play football to get out of this situation - that's the only way. ""We are very far from achieving what we want to, but the important thing is the commitment of the players and the way they help each other. The rest will come with time, for sure."" On Billing's red card: ""When I saw it [Billing's tackle] there was no doubt [it was a red]. He had no intention to play the ball and it was a kick from behind."" Clinton Morrison speaking on Sky Sports News: ""Bournemouth started the better of the two sides and went ahead through Kluivert, but you've got to credit Forest for the way they came back and levelled through Hudson-Odoi. ""In the second half, there was nothing in it with no clear-cut chances. Both teams defended well but lacked quality in the final third. ""A draw is a fair result but the tackle from Billing on Hudson-Odoi was a dangerous one. Nuno would have taken this result at the start of the game as Bournemouth have been in good form. ""Forest have got some tough games coming up - I think all of their next four are against teams in the top six. We have to see what will happen with the PSR breach so it is still a worrying time for them."" Nottingham Forest host Newcastle at the City Ground next Saturday, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 5.30pm.

23,AFCON: Ivory Coast 1-0 DR Congo - Sebastien Haller heroics sends two-time winners into fifth final,https://www.skysports.com/football/ivory-coast-vs-dr-congo/report/500696,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Sebastien Haller fired hosts Ivory Coast into the final of the Africa Cup of Nations and to within one match of the ultimate redemption after beating DR
Congo 1-0. The Elephants had been on the brink of elimination at the group stage, sacked their manager before being reprieved two days later as the fourth-best third-placed finishers. They then came back from behind to beat Senegal in the last 16 and needed a 90th-minute equaliser and a winner with the last kick of the match to get past Mali in the quarter-final. Now Haller's goal has seen them reach the final for a fifth time and if interim boss Emerse Fae, who replaced Jean-Louis Gasset after the humiliating 4-0 loss to Equatorial Guinea, can inspire them to victory over Nigeria on Sunday it will surely cap the most remarkable turn of fortunes in any major international tournament.

DR Congo, winners in 1968 and 1974, posed a potent threat and thought they had scored after nine minutes but Cedric Bakambu had kicked the ball out of the hands of goalkeeper Yahia Fofana before bundling it home. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ivory Coast, also two-time winners, created their first opportunity from quarter-final hero Simon Adingra, the Brighton winger rising at the far post and heading across goal and wide.

Moments later Franck Kessie's low drive from the edge of the area clipped the far post to leave the hosts frustrated at half-time. Congo sent on Theo Bongonda as a half-time substitute and the Spartak Moscow wideman almost had an instant impact with a mazy run into the area, beating three defenders before lashing his shot into the side-netting. Kessie stung the hands of Congo keeper Lionel Mpasi with a fierce drive with what was Ivory Coast's first shot on target. It was their second that broke the deadlock in the 64th minute. It was unorthodox, and a tad fortunate, Haller hooking Max Gradel's cross into the ground and watching it bounce and loop over Mpasi into the net. Incredibly it was the first time Ivory Coast had scored first in a match since the group opener against Guinea Bissau. Haller should have doubled the lead with an easier chance but sent his lob over Mpasi and wide, but the Elephants held on to book a spot in the final which looked unthinkable a fortnight ago."

27,Jodi Jones Interview: Notts County winger on being assists king of League Two and playing England at Wembley,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13070129/jodi-jones-interview-notts-county-winger-on-being-assists-king-of-league-two-and-playing-england-at-wembley,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Jodi Jones is on course for a record-breaking campaign in League Two. In January alone, the Malta international registered six assists, four of which came in a 5-5 draw away at Grimsby. ""I'm not too sure how it's happened to be honest,"" he tells Sky Sports after picking up the Sky Bet League Two Player of the Month award. ""I can only thank my team-mates. The way we work and the things we do allow me to get the ball and put it into dangerous areas. When you've got players like McGoldrick, Langstaff, Crowley and Nemane getting on the end of them, you know you've got a chance of getting loads of assists."" His tally currently stands at 18, already breaking the League Two record for most in a campaign. It is still only February. Not only does he have the most assists in the country, but also comes out on top when compared to players in the top-five European leagues. Jones, however, only smiles when he is compared with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne. ""People like him are a different level,"" he says. ""I need to be careful because he's back from injury now and could catch me in a couple of weeks! League Two free highlights League Two table Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""A target that I set myself is to get as many assists as possible so hopefully I can keep that up."" It hasn't always been record numbers for Jones, who suffered a myriad of injuries before arriving at Notts County, including three anterior cruciate ligament injuries in as many years. ""I owe a lot to Coventry City and all of the staff there,"" he says. ""They believed in me and gave me a platform to return to football when I was out. Also, to Notts County who took a risk on a player with bad injuries. ""When I get on a good run of form I don't get too far ahead of myself, because you know you can get hit with a setback, I try to stay level-headed."" Despite being born in east London, Jones represents Malta at international level, and took to the pitch against England in a European qualifier at Wembley last year. ""When I left Coventry, I wasn't playing too much and Malta were sending me a few messages. They were supporting me and wanted me to play,"" he says. ""I have been really enjoying it and playing against England was an amazing experience, especially to play in my home city."" Jones was also on the opposing side to a former team-mate of his at Coventry under the Wembley arch, in the shape of James Maddison. ""We were speaking before the first game in Malta about him getting called up and he deservedly did,"" says Jones. ""It was a good feeling playing against a friend and playing against England. Being from the country and the majority of my family being from here just made that day something I will never forget. ""It's up there as one of my greatest achievements, walking on to the pitch before was a feeling that I have never felt. There are plenty of other moments so I'm not sure where it ranks, but it is definitely up there."" Another proud moment of Jones' career came in the National League play-offs last season. His 120th-minute semi-final winner sent Notts County to Wembley as they beat Boreham Wood, and they then went on to beat Chesterfield to secure a return to the EFL after four years away. ""That moment made all the rehab worthwhile,"" he reflects. ""It wiped out all of the injury nightmares and made me feel so proud. There were so many times I could have crumbled, but that moment made me feel happy to have carried on."" The momentum Notts County gained from promotion has carried into this season. They sit 10th in League Two and are eyeing back-to-back promotions. Jones sees no reason why the club can't go on and achieve promotion this season. ""Without being too biased I think we're the best team in the league,"" he says. ""The way we play is something I really enjoy. We have been unlucky in some games and we're still working on things but with these players, we do need to get promoted. It's something I believe will happen.""

The 53-year-old is under contract until December and is preparing to lead England into his fourth major tournament after taking charge in September 2016. However, Southgate accepts it is also possible he may not be in charge by the time England play Nations League matches against the Republic of Ireland, Greece and Finland in the autumn. The former Middlesbrough boss insists a decision over his future is not yet made and he remains open to the possibility of staying to work with England's exciting crop of players, led by Real Madrid superstar Jude Bellingham. ""There's a fair chance half the coaches won't be here after the Euros. That's international football,"" Southgate said at the Nations League draw in Paris on Thursday. ""You've got to see how the summer goes. It's as simple as that. ""In my view, I know what we're capable of achieving in the summer. I know what my own benchmark of success would be.

""I think everybody in England will think it was a big disappointment to drop down to League B but you still have difficult games. ""Obviously our objective will be to try to win the group to get back into League A."" Discussing England's previous experiences in the Nations League, Southgate said: ""We've had varied experiences. The first time, we finished third, the second two have been complicated for us. In all three versions, we've used it to look at new players. ""Of course, you have to balance looking at new players with winning games and we didn't manage to do that last time. ""The competition pairs the best with the best and my impressions of it have been really good. ""Unfortunately, the second one reminds me of Covid and the third one we didn't play well.

Philippe Clement has breathed new life into the title race since taking over at Ibrox and his side are now level on points with Celtic, after a 2-1 win over Aberdeen on Tuesday. It has been a 10-point swing since October and the Hoops - who drew at Aberdeen on Saturday after a frustrating transfer window - now visit Hibernian on Wednesday night live on Sky Sports. Rodgers, however, remains fully focused on what his side need to do if they are to retain the title. ""When you win any league you have to earn the right, but I also think that competition makes you better,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""I spent enough years in the Premier League and I could see the improvements that Man City could make because of the challenges they had around them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's no different in any of the leagues, competition is the catalyst to improve and be better, there's no doubt Rangers have done that but primarily our focus is on ourselves and improving our own performance.

""There are still so many games left. We've obviously dropped points and it's not satisfying, but knowing that we maybe haven't been as consistent as what we would have liked, but are still in a really good position. ""There are lots of points to play for and the best team will win the league over the course of 38 games."" Celtic made two January signings with Nicolas Kuhn joining on a five-and-a-half-year deal and Adam Idah moving on loan from Norwich on deadline day. The players ran out to chants of ""sack the board"" and a banner that read ""Celtic board, on your heads be it"" at Pittodrie as the fans expressed their displeasure over the club's transfer window business. Rodgers understands their frustration. ""Clearly you'd prefer everyone being together but supporters are entitled to make their opinion and always will be, especially the demands of this football club,"" he added. ""All I can concentrate on is making sure the players have that clarity when they go into the games so we don't focus so much on the mistakes, we look at how we could be better."" Daizen Maeda is available for Wednesday's game at Easter Road after returning from the Asian Cup. He made two substitute appearances for Japan before starting in Saturday's quarter-final defeat by Iran, playing the first 67 minutes, and Rodgers feels the attacker is up to speed after his international duties. ""Daizen Maeda is back, which is great news, and fit and healthy,"" Rodgers said. ""He is actually in a better place now than he was when he left because he was still trying to get up to speed. ""He has gone away, trained, played some games. I spoke to him when he did come back and he feels ready to start if we need him.""

Unfortunately for Thomas Tuchel and Harry Kane, that's where the German giants now find themselves. Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen extended Xabi Alonso's side's lead at the top of the table to five points, and that was followed up by a 1-0 loss at Lazio in their Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday. But it's not just the results that are causing alarm in Bavaria - it's the performances, too. Not only did Bayern fail to score in either of their last two matches, but they only recorded a combined total of one shot on target. Bayern don't even have the DFB-Pokal to fall back on, having been stunned by third-tier side Saarbrucken in the second round. Tuchel's side also lost the German Super Cup to RB Leipzig on Kane's debut - raising the prospect of another season without a trophy for the England captain. That's not the kind of season that's accepted in Munich. Less than a year into his reign, Tuchel is under serious pressure. Tuchel joined Bayern in March last year and quickly wrapped up another Bundesliga title - the first of his career. But in truth, much of the work had been done by Julian Naglesmann, his predecessor, who was surprisingly sacked with the champions just one point behind leaders Borussia Dortmund. Bayern Munich fixtures Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Tuchel's side only won the title on goal difference and Dortmund would have been crowned champions if they had not drawn at home to Mainz, who finished ninth, on the season's final day. Statistically, Bayern have improved in the Bundesliga this season, winning more points, scoring more and conceding fewer goals per game than in the previous campaign. But even that improvement hasn't been enough to keep up with Leverkusen, who are still yet to lose in any competition this season. Meanwhile, Tuchel has failed to win any of the three Champions League knockout matches he has overseen as Bayern boss, and has lost two of his three matches in the DFB-Pokal. In total, Tuchel has now lost 10 of his 43 matches as Bayern manager. It took Nagelsmann 84 games to reach that mark. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The former Chelsea manager's tactics have been called into question recently, too, with a surprise switch to a 3-4-3 formation at Leverkusen resulting in failure. Tuchel's preference for Eric Dier, who only arrived in January, over Matthijs de Ligt at centre-back has also caused consternation. After the defeat at Lazio, Tuchel insisted he was not concerned about his future. But the head coach also admitted he was ""not sure"" what had gone wrong, adding ""I can't explain it"". Being unable to answer those questions is never a good sign and, as Nagelsmann's exit showed, Bayern coaches are rarely granted much time to find the answers. Bayern's problems have come to a head in the past week but perhaps they had been lying under the surface for some time. Kane's 28 goals in his first 27 games after arriving from Tottenham papered over the cracks - and were bailing out his fellow forwards. Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman are injured but Leroy Sane has not scored in the Bundesliga since October, Jamal Musiala has no goals in his last six games and Thomas Muller has only found the net twice all season. Kane could only carry the burden for so long. The tipping point came against Leverkusen and Lazio, when he recorded a total of six touches in the opposition box. On Sky Sports News, Danny Mills described Kane as ""anonymous"" in the Stadio Olimpico. But there's only so much a No 9 can do if the team behind them isn't functioning. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking on CBS, Jamie Carragher called Bayern ""a team of individuals, not a team right now"". Muller last week suggested his team-mates lacked courage, telling Sky Sports: ""We are showing significantly better approaches in training."" Kane was more measured on Wednesday, urging his team-mates to ""keep fighting"" when speaking to TNT Sports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But the prospect of yet another season ending empty-handed won't be lost on Kane, whose failure to collect a team trophy despite receiving multiple individual awards is now infamous. Since making his professional debut 13 years ago, Kane has lost in the Champions League, Carabao Cup and Euro 2020 finals, while he has never finished higher than second in the league. His move to Bayern - who have won 27 trophies since Kane's first professional appearance - was meant to finally bring an end to that drought. But the only trophy coming Kane's way this season may be another individual award for topping the Bundesliga scoring charts - a prize that looks curiously like the cannon on Arsenal's badge... Sky Sports' Nick Wright speaking on The Football Show: ""It's hard to be too critical because we are talking about a player who has scored 28 goals in 29 games this season. ""Tuchel has got the best out of him. It's more of a dip than something indicative of what's happened this season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""He's using him slightly differently to how he was used at Spurs. We were used to him dropping deep and linking the play at Spurs. ""He doesn't do that as much at Bayern. There are fewer touches and fewer passes, but more shots and touches in the opposition box. So even though he's not as involved in their play, he is more effective in terms of goalscoring. ""But when he's not scoring, he does look a little more isolated. That's the problem for him at the moment I think."" Watch Bochum vs Bayern Munich on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Football; kick-off 4.30pm.

34,QPR 2-2 Norwich City: Michael Frey scores first Rangers goal to earn important point,https://www.skysports.com/football/qpr-vs-norwich/report/485069,Author not found,Publish time not found,"New signing Michael Frey rescued a point for struggling QPR and put a dent in Norwich's play-off aspirations in an entertaining 2-2 draw at Loftus Road. Second-half goals from Kenny McLean and Josh Sargent looked to have sealed the points for the visitors after Jack Colback put Rangers in front midway through the first half. But Frey diverted a cross from fellow new boy Lucas Andersen past keeper Angus Gunn to extend QPR's unbeaten run to four matches. QPR started the better side, with Joe Hodge shooting just wide from distance, while Chris Willock should have done better when he fired straight at Gunn from inside the six-yard box. Borja Sainz saw a shot flash just past the post for Norwich's best chance before Colback opened the scoring in the 28th minute. Gunn palmed Willock's right-wing cross only as far as Colback and the midfielder fired in his third goal of the season. Norwich came racing out of the traps after half-time and levelled in the 48th minute when McLean escaped his marker to tap in a short corner past the leaden-footed Asmir Begovic. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Canaries boss David Wagner introduced the exciting Jonathan Rowe from the bench in the 59th minute and he made an immediate impact by setting up the move that led to Norwich's second goal. Rowe picked out Jack Stacey on the right flank after a good run from midfield and the full-back swung in a perfect cross to find Sargent who rose above the Rangers defence to head past Begovic and give the visitors a 62nd-minute lead. The goal stunned the sell-out home crowd and it was Norwich who looked the more likely to win the game, with Ashley Barnes and Onel Hernandez shooting wide. But it was the introduction of new arrivals Frey and Andersen from the bench by head coach Marti Cifuentes that got Rangers back on level terms in the 77th minute. Picking the ball up on the right flank from a throw-in, Denmark international Andersen, who only joined the club on Monday, rolled a smart pass into the box and Frey held off Ben Gibson to divert the ball past Gunn. Norwich pushed hard for a winner and Begovic made a vital stop with his body to deny Barnes as he bore down on goal. The point was not enough to see Rangers climb out the bottom three but it closed the gap on Huddersfield, the team immediately above the drop zone, to two points. Norwich slipped to eighth in the table - two points outside the play-off positions. QPR's Marti Cifuentes: ""I can never be happy with just a point, but we played against a strong team that scored two quality goals. ""We managed to have good moments, both in the first half and the second, and I want to praise the attitude and the mentality of the guys. ""It's not easy to be behind at home in the situation that we are in. But we had the mental strength and capacity to keep on pushing - and after the equaliser from Frey we still tried to go for the victory."" Norwich's David Wagner: ""Performance-wise, OK. Intensity and energy, top. Result, a little bit frustrating. But I think it's a positive if we are frustrated at getting a point away from home against QPR in a game where we have come back from one down. ""Unfortunately we didn't score the third one where Barnsey had a great opportunity. Then we conceded a sloppy goal, which cost us. ""Our biggest challenge today was not to get too emotional and to stay calm. I think when we did that we looked very good in possession and were able to break them down and create opportunities. ""So I'm a little bit frustrated that we haven't won this game, because it was possible. We should be fair also and say that performance-wise this was OK. ""Unfortunately it's only a point. I think it's OK if there's a little bit of frustration about only getting the point after being 1-0 down at half-time away from home. ""We should look at the performance as well. You only have positive results if you perform consistently and this is what the players have done in recent weeks."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

35,"Liverpool 3-1 Burnley: Diogo Jota, Luiz Diaz, Darwin Nunez score to send Reds top of Premier League",https://www.skysports.com/football/liverpool-vs-burnley/report/482824,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Liverpool returned to the top of the Premier League with a deserved 3-1 victory over Burnley in front of a record attendance at Anfield. Manchester City had climbed above the Reds earlier on Saturday thanks to Erling Haaland's double in a 2-0 win over Everton, but a crowd of 59,896 roared Jurgen Klopp's side back in front by two points But Burnley, seven points adrift of safety, gave them an almighty scare after Diogo Jota had nodded the hosts in front with Dara O'Shea powering a brilliant header in at a corner before the break. Luis Diaz restored Liverpool's lead early in the second half but the goal was subject to a lengthy VAR check for offside while there was also potentially a foul in the build-up on Aaron Ramsey by Alexis Mac Allister that led to Burnley manager Vincent Kompany being booked. Chelsea loanee David Datro Fofona then missed two huge chances to bring Burnley level before Darwin Nunez steered a late header into the left corner to secure the points. Liverpool: Kelleher (7), Robertson (6), Quansah (6), Van Dijk (6), Alexander-Arnold (7), Endo (7), Mac Allister (7), Jones (7), Diaz (8), Nunez (8), Jota (8).


Subs:  Elliott (8), Gakpo (n/a), Clark (n/a), McConnell (n/a), Tsimikas (n/a)/


Burnley: Trafford (5), Assignon (6), O'Shea (7), Esteve (6), Delcroix (5), Brownhill (6), Berge (6), Ramsey (6), Odobert (6), Fofana (5), Amdouni (6).


Subs:  Vitinho (n/a), Bruun Larsen (n/a), Massengo (n/a).


Player of the Match: Luis Diaz Caoimhin Kelleher started in goal for Liverpool in place of the sick Alisson and produced a smart save early on with his right hand to deny Zeki Amdouni, who had burst into the area past Virgil van Dijk, amid a bright start from the visitors. Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy yet went ahead against the run of play just after the half-hour mark. Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner lured goalkeeper James Trafford off his line but he failed in his attempts to catch the delivery which allowed Jota to head into an empty net. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! That sparked the hosts into life with Diaz denied by Trafford from close range before Klopp was shown a yellow card for his protests when Jota was not awarded a penalty after going down in the box under pressure from Hannes Delcroix. But on the stroke of half-time, Burnley grabbed the equaliser their performance deserved. Josh Brownhill's out-swinging corner was powered into the top right corner by the head of O'Shea from 12 yards. Alexander-Arnold was subbed at half-time for Harvey Elliott although it did not affect Liverpool at the start of the second half. Diaz soon nodded in from the substitute's low cross with Burnley wanting the goal ruled out by VAR. Burnley, though, should have equalised when Fofana burst through and Kelleher produced a big save to deny him. The follow-up was then lashed wide by Wilson Odobert before Fofana had another golden opportunity moments later yet shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. Trafford parried from Jota and Jarell Quansah volleyed narrowly wide of the left post but Burnley could not keep Liverpool out again when Nunez deftly scored with his head. He should have had a second in added time yet toe-poked straight at the goalkeeper. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp speaking to Sky Sports: ""I can really imagine how Vincent Kompany is feeling right now because they did a lot of good stuff and made it really uncomfortable for us. ""But in general, besides the first 15 minutes, when we were in a rush and we played too early, they had counter-attacks and situations and that was a problem. Then we calmed it down and scored wonderful goals. ""We knew at half-time what we had to do. We were in control but we had to change Trent Alexander-Arnold and are short on defenders. Curtis Jones did incredibly well, like Harvey Elliott did when he came on. ""It was a difficult game with strange circumstances. It's just with all the things that happened with players out, the goalkeeper stepping aside, it was the perfect afternoon - besides the Trent thing obviously."" On Trent Alexander-Arnold's injury: ""Same area in the knee. Nothing really bad but he felt it again and we have to see. We will assess it. We were made aware of it in the game so thought, 'What can we do' then Trent said, 'No it's fine'. But it's not as he feels it so we had to be careful and take him off."" On title race: ""I know it's every week. You add in Tottenham - who got a big win for them today. Villa play tomorrow. They are all in the mix and Arsenal. ""Two weeks ago we had the perfect squad situation. Two weeks later we are short in each area. Like, wow. It all can happen. We all need luck to get through it when you don't have that, you have to fight through it."" On Joe Gomez and Alisson absences: ""We thought Joe Gomez would be back but he had a temperature yesterday so we had to send him home. Alisson felt unwell, couldn't sleep or eat really so that's not helpful."" On his yellow card: ""It was emotional, definitely. Imagine in this game the referee had a blue card available. It would have been the wild west. There were so many yellow cards today. I had no clue why Vincent Kompany got it. I lost it in that situation so fine, give me a yellow card. As long as I don't get a blue one and have to sit somewhere for 10 minutes."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Burnley boss Vincent Kompany speaking to Sky Sports: ""It was as good as a performance as you need to have a chance of getting a result somewhere like Anfield. There were lots of positives. We will always feel disappointed about the result but the message to the team is we keep growing. Every day of the week we need to continue with that belief. ""It wasn't just those two chances. In the first half, we had many moments where we broke and could have finished with a one-on-one so it's the final ball and final details. They have good players too. You need a little something going your way and there was not enough of that today for us to get a result. ""I understand from Liverpool's perspective, they are always awkward games. There is an expectation from fans to see those games off early and to have a little bit of a quiet afternoon but that's something we can benefit from. I've been on the other side many times and know how awkward these things can be. We made it difficult and these types of performances can't remain unrewarded in the future. ""It's in moments like this that you show what you are made of. I have my eyes wide open and don't want to hide away from toughness. We do ourselves proud and our fans proud. People can tell you what you don't achieve in life, but they don't say what you still can achieve."" On his yellow card: ""I'd say it's a little bit to do with the game. I think I got booked because I should have paid attention to the fact that Jurgen Klopp got booked because then all I think the referee did was just went looking for me. ""I opened my arms out which I have done exactly that in many games. Then all of a sudden the card comes out. Out of nothing. Now I am suspended for the next game. I should have known it was just a way to balance it out and it doesn't make sense, but hey, we have to keep going. No sulking.""

36,Man Utd teenagers Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho are stepping up for Erik ten Hag ahead of season run-in,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13062148/man-utd-teenagers-kobbie-mainoo-and-alejandro-garnacho-are-stepping-up-for-erik-ten-hag-ahead-of-season-run-in,Sam Blitz,Publish time not found,"If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season. The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive. Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa. And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most. Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. ""His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,"" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance. Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot. Stream Man Utd vs West Ham on Sky with NOW Get Sky Sports Man Utd fixtures Live Premier League table Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other. But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle. In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career. And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out. The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords. In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left. The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player. It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals. Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack. But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for. Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season. Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.

37,Brighton 4-1 Crystal Palace: Pressure grows on Roy Hodgson and Eagles board after thrashing at hands of rivals,https://www.skysports.com/football/brighton-vs-c-palace/report/482814,Joe Shread,Publish time not found,"Brighton blew Crystal Palace away with a brilliant first-half performance as they claimed a 4-1 win over their rivals, whose supporters once again protested against the board. It was a miserable afternoon on the south coast for Palace, who were without the injured Eberechi Eze, while Michael Olise limped off just minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute. The game was as good as over at that point thanks to the Seagulls’ sensational opening half, which saw Lewis Dunk head in an early opener. Two goals in two minutes from Jack Hinshelwood and Facundo Buonanotte stunned the visitors, whose fans responded by unfurling banners against Steve Parish and the rest of the board. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Jean-Phillipe Mateta’s header pulled a goal back for Palace but a brilliant Joao Pedro strike in the final minutes was the cue for many of the away fans to head for the exits. Whether the under-pressure Roy Hodgson follows them remains to be seen. Brighton: Verbruggen (7), Van Hecke (7), Dunk (8), Igor (7), Hinshelwood (8), Gilmour (7), Gross (8), Lamptey (8), Buonanotte (8), Ferguson (7), Pedro (8).


Subs: Welbeck (7), Baleba (6), Estupinan (6), Fati (n/a), Lallana (n/a).


Crystal Palace: Henderson (5), Munoz (5), Andersen (5), Guehi (6), Mitchell (5), Lerma (6), Richards (5), Hughes (6), Ayew (6), Mateta (7), Schlupp (6).


Subs: Wharton (4), Olise (n/a), Franca (6), Edouard (6), Ahamada (6).


Man of the match: Pascal Gross Palace may have been the Premier League's top spenders during the January window but it took less than 45 minutes for the protests that took place during the 5-0 thrashing at Arsenal last month to be repeated at the Amex. Daniel Munoz and Adam Wharton, the Eagles' mid-season signings, both endured difficult debuts, while the Palace supporters appeared to react angrily to the players when approached at full-time. Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Watch free Premier League highlights It made for an ugly afternoon for Hodgson's side, who found themselves behind after less than two minutes when Dunk nodded in Pascal Gross' corner. Jack Hinshelwood then guided home a header at the far post after Tariq Lamptey had again bested Munoz, before Wharton lost the ball on the edge of his own box to allow Buonanotte to bend home a third just moments later. Hodgson - who had already lost captain Marc Guehi to a first-half injury - called for Olise at half-time in a bid to salvage the game. Speaking about Olise's return last month, Hodgson talked of the difficulties in managing his star player's return amid the advice from his medical team, saying he couldn't run his team ""scientifically"". Unfortunately for Hodgson, his decision backfired, with Olise asking to be replaced less than 10 minutes after coming on with an apparent hamstring injury. Perhaps it was all too easy for Brighton, who failed to get out of second gear for much of the second half and were eventually punished for their sloppiness when Mateta guided in Joachim Andersen's cross. However, Pedro woke his team-mates from their slumber after a fine one-two with Danny Welbeck, finding the bottom corner and ensuring Brighton produced the perfect response to their hammering at Luton in midweek by moving up to seventh, while Palace are 14th and just five points above the relegation zone. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: ""At the moment our fans aren't very happy with everything that is happening at the club and they are making their feelings known as well. But I signed up to be the manager and coach of this football club and I've got the strength, resilience and determination to see things through. I'm certainly not going to be cowed by that type of thing."" On Olise's injury: ""I was told he couldn't start the game, everyone was quite comfortable with that. But they told me, and he told me, he was fine to be on the bench and to play in the second half. Unfortunately I don't have a crystal ball and I wasn't to know that would lead to a recurrence of his injury."" On the players engaging with angry fans after full time: ""They are realistic enough to know the fans aren't going to be happy to see their team lose 4-1 and I think the players did the right thing. No one is less happy than ourselves. At least they went over to thank the fans and let them know we are grateful for their support. If people react, so be it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi: ""We are very happy because in a derby we made our fans happy, but I'm not surprised with the reaction we showed. ""Our win started on Tuesday after the Luton game. I'm really pleased with the result, the reaction, the energy."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread at the Amex Stadium: Crystal Palace are at a crossroads. For so long, mid-table stability, combined with developing a smattering of exciting young players, has been enough for the south Londoners. Much of that stability has been provided by Steve Parish, whose backing helped to bring the club up from the Championship, and Roy Hodgson, who has done so much across two spells to keep the Eagles in the Premier League. But now many of the supporters want more. Shorn of Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise for much of the season, Palace have slipped to just five points above the relegation zone, while winning just two of their last 14 games. Hodgson's side have conceded nine goals in their last two away games, both of which saw fans turn on Parish and the board. January's investment in Adam Wharton and Daniel Munoz doesn't appear to have placated the fanbase. With Hodgson aged 76 and only having a contract until the end of the season, a change in the dugout is surely coming sooner rather than later. But what then? Palace only have the 12th-highest net spend over the past five seasons and have been missing arguably their three best players - Eze, Olise and Cheikh Doucoure - for huge chunks of the campaign. Is it fair to ask them to be achieving any more than they already are? Palace supporters may want to be careful what they wish for. Michael Dawson speaking on Soccer Saturday: ""There were banners and protests. 'Parish and co, time to go' was one banner. At the end, you could see the fans' frustrations. Andersen goes over and confronts it. ""It wasn't great scenes at the end. It's doom and gloom at Palace because without Olise and Eze, they're in a little bit of trouble. ""Toxic atmosphere? Very much so. I don't feel it, I see it. The fans were trying to get onto the pitch, there were barriers and they were stood on there. ""Andersen, the captain because Guehi went off, he confronted it. Paddy McCarthy, the coach, went over there. You could feel tension and friction between the fans and they're really not happy.""

39,Erling Haaland looking ominous as Andy Robertson returns for Liverpool - Premier League hits and misses,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/13067552/erling-haaland-looking-ominous-as-andy-robertson-returns-for-liverpool-premier-league-hits-and-misses,Author not found,Publish time not found," Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is a measure of Erling Haaland's extraordinary productivity that his first goals in almost three months are enough to send him two clear at the top of the Premier League scoring charts. The striker had gone four games without scoring either side of his foot injury in December but his match-winning double against Everton on Saturday ended his mini-drought, taking him to 16 for the season and making it 10 wins on the bounce for City. Can anyone stop them? It seems increasingly unlikely now that the big Norwegian is hitting his stride again. ""The finishing was amazing,"" said a smiling Pep Guardiola afterwards. His goals showed his capacity for both power and subtlety as he slammed in the first following a corner, then calmly stroked home the second having shrugged off Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite. It helps, of course, to have Kevin De Bruyne providing the ammunition again. The Belgian, another recent returnee, now has four assists in only 215 Premier League minutes since his comeback. The pass to release Haaland for the second goal was his 12th assist for the 23-year-old since the start of last season. The deadly duo are back. And that means City are in business.Nick Wright Live Premier League table Watch free Premier League highlights Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports Jarrad Branthwaite spent the majority of Everton's meeting with Manchester City on Saturday showing the watching Gareth Southgate why he should at the very least be on England's radar. For over an hour, the 21-year-old centre-back was outstanding, winning duels, positioning himself exactly where he needed to be to cut out crosses, showing composure on the ball and generally ensuring Erling Haaland had little impact on the game. The problem is what happened next. In the 71st minute, his attempted clearance fell straight to the City striker to slam the opener past Jordan Pickford. Not long after that, he ended up in a heap on the turf as Haaland ran through him to score his second. He is not the first defender to come off worse in a battle with Haaland, of course. But it was a reminder, nonetheless, of just how quickly fortunes can change when you are up against the elite. Branthwaite's form this season has been such that he is sure to be in Southgate's thoughts when he ponders his centre-back selections for this summer's European Championship. But so will his struggles in those last 20 minutes against Haaland.Nick Wright Andy Robertson - remember him? Liverpool coped remarkably in his absence. It was a run that stretched 18 domestic matches across all competitions due to a shoulder injury yet Liverpool went unbeaten. Joe Gomez came in and looked like he'd been playing left-back all his life. But Liverpool have missed Robertson. This all-action and dynamic performance was a reminder of the creative force he offers Jurgen Klopp's men down that flank. When Trent Alexander-Arnold departed at half-time, he sprung to the fore as Liverpool's main outlet out wide. He made 327 intensive runs - as defined by Opta - that was more than any other player as his constant willingness to run hard and fast kept Liverpool's tempo at full throttle during key moments in a match they allowed Burnley snippets of hope. When he burst into those attacking positions, his quality was up to the usual standard. He created five chances from a total of 14 crosses into the box. Liverpool's flying Scotsman is back.Lewis Jones Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a pretty strange situation Burnley are in, they cause everybody problems."" Even Jurgen Klopp could not quite explain why Vincent Kompany's side has only 13 points from 24 games, seems destined for the drop and yet performs well for large parts of matches. It is in both boxes where their problems are obvious. They give away easy goals, like James Trafford flapping at air for Diogo Jota's opener, and don't take their chances, like David Datro Fofana's two glaring misses. Perhaps they are also guilty of being too nice. Aaron Ramsey needed to hit the deck on the edge of his own area when Alexis Mac Allister kicked his right shin. To his credit, the Burnley midfielder played on but seconds later Liverpool had scored their second and the VAR wasn't interested in a potential free-kick. With one win in their last 10 league games, Burnley's Premier League status is fading but their performances are not.David Richardson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For most of the second half, it looked as though the narrative after this game was going to be how Ange Postecoglou’s substitutions backfired. The Tottenham manager made a triple change in the 63rd minute, bringing on Heung-Min Son, Brennan Johnson and Yves Bissouma moments after Pape Sarr had scored his side’s equaliser. Spurs were enjoying their best spell of the game - but with the subs came a loss of momentum. Timo Werner’s pace, Dejan Kulusevski’s creativity and Rodrigo Bentancur’s control had been lost. Instead, Brighton regained the upper hand, while Spurs mustered just two shots in the following 30 minutes. But then the changes paid off. With space to run into after a turnover in possession, Son did what Werner couldn’t during his time on the pitch, executing the perfect pass for an unmarked Johnson to fire into the net. After producing so little for most of the second half, Postecoglou’s two attacking subs combined to score the winner - Spurs’ fifth in a row at home in the Premier League. As the delirious celebrations at full-time showed, Postecoglou can do no wrong in the eyes of Spurs’ supporters.Joe Shread Roberto De Zerbi may have been back in Italy due to a combination of dental surgery and a touchline ban but the approach of his side in north London was familiar - risky, aggressive and highly entertaining. Ultimately, that high-stakes approach cost them, with a loss of possession in a dangerous area as they looked to clinch an impressive away win allowing Brennan Johnson to deliver a sucker punch deep into injury time. It’s tempting to conclude that Brighton should have been more cautious. But in fact, Johnson’s winner was the first time they have dropped points in the Premier League this season by conceding in the 75th minute or later. What’s more, the Seagulls have come from behind to claim draws in the final 15 minutes on four separate occasions. Brighton’s attacking approach works - just look at the progress they’ve made under De Zerbi since his arrival in the autumn of 2022. They were on top in the final 30 minutes at Spurs and just as easily could have been celebrating a late win of their own. But Seagulls fans know by now that, with De Zerbi in charge, there will be the occasional bitter blow along with the thrilling highs.Joe Shread Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Let the people speak."" That was Bruno Guimaraes' explanation for putting his fingers in his ears as he celebrated scoring the winning goal in front of Newcastle's jubilant supporters at the City Ground on Saturday evening. The Brazilian sent a reassuring message to the away fans who had made the journey to Nottingham Forest and the millions more watching worldwide. His future has been the subject of intense speculation in recent transfer windows, but he's going nowhere. ""Sometimes people speak a lot about me. I just speak a lot about football. I'm very happy here,"" Guimaraes told Sky Sports after producing a brilliant individual performance to drag his side to a 3-2 victory. The 26-year-old was instrumental throughout. As well as scoring from both his shots on target, he won possession more times than anyone else on the pitch (11) and completed an impressive 20 passes in the final third, demonstrating his all-round midfield qualities once again. Guimaraes has been a revelation since arriving from Lyon for £40m in January 2022. Newcastle have struggled to reach the heights of last season but with him in their ranks, they remain capable of beating anyone. ""The fans have been unbelievable for me and my family. I hope this can keep going for a long time,"" he added at the final whistle. Newcastle will take great comfort from their talisman's latest comments as they look to build some momentum in the second half of the campaign and push for European qualification.Dan Sansom Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ivan Toney immediately grabs the headlines when he scores, and his role in an unusually clinical Brentford win at Wolves is not in question. But the reason the Bees have dropped 26 points from winning positions this season centres more around their inability to keep clean sheets than score goals. Even accounting for their talisman's absence, they have drawn a blank only three times all season, while their victory at Molineux was their fourth clean sheet. They have won all four shut-outs, and this was perhaps their most impressive, ending Wolves' run of scoring in 18 straight home games. Frank acknowledged the significance of his side's defensive improvement after the game when he hailed their ""clean-sheet mentality"", something which will be crucial if they are to move further away from the relegation zone. The Bees' reputation since promotion has been built on solidity. They conceded only three goals more than Arsenal or Man Utd last season, and eight teams shipped more even in their first Premier League. This is a side as strong in the defensive transition as they are dangerous on the counter-attack. The role of Mark Flekken plays a part and victory at Molineux would have been impossible without another impressive performance from the reinvigorated goalkeeper. Whether his display against Manchester City on Monday was a turning point remains to be seen, but he is enjoying a hot streak either way - and Brentford look far better for it. But further forward, the gaps between Brentford's defence and midfield were noticeably smaller. The job Mathias Jensen and Vitaly Janelt did on Wolves' wing-backs was relentless and influential, and the quality of the press from back to front was, at least before half-time, back to the Brentford of old. Frank has insisted his side's recent slump has not been a reflection of their performances, but recently they have not been the same Bees that we've become accustomed to. Whether the glimmer they showed in the West Midlands is replicated over the coming weeks will go a long way to deciding whether they might still enjoy another season to remember on their fairytale rise.Ron Walker Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  What a difference seven days make. From being thrashed 5-0 at home to Aston Villa to a near-perfect away performance, especially defensively, at Luton. Not many gave Sheffield United a chance at Kenilworth Road. The Blades have the worst defensive record in the league and Luton were in form. After all, Rob Edwards' side went on to have 20 shots. But while the Blades were sloppy last week, they were ""steely"" this week, according to manager Chris Wilder. There was a resolution not to concede. Jayden Bogle, Anel Ahmedhodzic and Mason Holgate had 27 clearances between them, 19 of them with their heads. But at the heart of the Blades' win was Vinicius Souza, who Wilder nearly threw into the away end in the full-time celebrations. The midfielder joined his defenders in being imperious at the back, whilst also popping up at the other end with a result-sealing goal. Sheffield United are still up against it when it comes to the relegation fight but they have Brighton, Wolves, Fulham and Bournemouth within their next six games. They need to get a move on, but gaining consistency after this result will be key to their survival.Sam Blitz ""Neither one were penalties in my opinion,"" said Luton manager Rob Edwards. In a week where VAR was handed a 96 per cent success rate, it was under the spotlight at Kenilworth Road. Two penalties were given to Luton and Sheffield United. Both were correct within the rules, but should they be? Either side of half-time, both Reece Burke and Vinicius Souza simply jumped for a header, like any defenders would, and their punishment was being penalised for a penalty. Neither player was looking at the ball, but their outstretched arm which over-extended their body position meant both decisions of handball are justified within the current rules. Should we accept this? ""I don't know what a penalty is anymore when it comes to handball. Neither player is looking at the ball and had their hands up,"" added Edwards. Instead of fussing over whether blue cards and sin bins are the way forward, the lawmakers should look back and see whether this handball rule is fit for purpose.Sam Blitz Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is fair to say Rodrigo Muniz has taken his time to settle at Fulham following his arrival at the club from Flamengo in August 2021, but it looks the striker is now ready to take his chance in west London. Having helped the Cottagers gain promotion back to the Premier League in his debut campaign with Marco Silva's side, Muniz was then sent out on loan to Middlesbrough last season. However, the Brazilian struggled in the north east, scoring just twice, and returned to the capital looking to re-establish himself as Fulham's main marksman following Aleksandar Mitrovic's departure to Al Hilal in August. But with first-choice forward Raul Jimenez injured against Everton, Silva turned to Muniz rather than on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broj - and the 22-year-old has not let his manager down, scoring his first Premier League goal for the club in last weekend's 2-2 draw at Burnley, before grabbing two more in Saturday's 3-1 home win over Bournemouth. And after the game, Silva highlighted Muniz's display, saying: ""This afternoon was probably his best performance in a Fulham shirt and he deserves it because he's worked really hard. ""He had a good preseason followed by a bad injury, but now he's coming back and he's fighting for what he wants and he's showing the desire to play as the Fulham striker."" All of which means the Portuguese will have a tricky choice to make in attack when Jimenez returns from injury, with the exciting Broja also on the bench against the Cherries. But after this eye-catching performance up front, it would be a brave man not to continue with Muniz when Aston Villa visit the Cottage next Saturday.Richard Morgan You can now start receiving messages and alerts for the latest breaking sports news, analysis, in-depth features and videos from our dedicated WhatsApp channel!

The 31-year-old has agreed a two-year deal with the option of a further year. Lingard had remained a free agent since leaving Nottingham Forest last summer and sacked his agents earlier this month - including members of his family - in an attempt to find a new club. Prior to his stint at the City Ground, Lingard enjoyed a successful loan spell with West Ham in 2021. During the campaign, he scored nine goals in his 16 appearances in all competitions. Across an illustrious career, Lingard has won the Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup with Manchester United, having made 232 appearances for the Red Devils after progressing through the club's academy. He had grown very frustrated that several contract offers and enquiries since his Forest exit had failed to materialise. Lingard came close to joining Saudi Arabian side Al Ettifaq in October but the deal suffered a late collapse.

41,"Jermain Defoe exclusive interview: The hunger that drove him, the impact of Bradley Lowery, and being a manager",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13072314/jermain-defoe-exclusive-interview-the-hunger-that-drove-him-the-impact-of-bradley-lowery-and-being-a-manager,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"“Football was always an escape. When I was playing, I never thought about anything else regardless of what I was going through off the pitch. Then the final whistle goes and all the problems of life comes on top of you. ""I was like that from the age of eight."" Jermain Defoe is discussing his life story, the subject of a new documentary, Defoe, to be released in cinemas for one night only at the end of this month.  It is an unusual mix, blending familiar tropes of sporting success with the tragedy that provided the backdrop to some of his best moments. Defoe is a fan of sporting documentaries, highlighting the recent examples of Ricky Hatton and Ronnie O'Sullivan. But why put his name to one himself? ""I think it is important not only for me but for others to do it because I think you see the person behind the footballer,"" he says. Download the Sky Sports app Read more football features ""It would be nice for people to reflect. See what I have achieved but at the same understand what has gone on away from football. ""There are all these things that people do not know. I do not want people to feel sorry for me, I want them to understand that tough times never last. I just thought it was the right time for people to really understand who I am."" Who he really is might surprise. There are the contradictions. Some, such as the swimming pool he is constructing at his home despite the fact that he does not swim, are trivial. Others are profound. Defoe describes himself as guarded, single-minded, a man with a laser-like focus on football. And yet, few at his level of fame have connected with a young fan as he did with Bradley Lowery. Speaking to Sky Sports in a small room at a private members' club in Soho, this quaint Dickensian retreat amid the hustle and bustle of London life outside feels like the perfect place to explore those contradictions. The discussion is always honest, occasionally enlightening, and briefly intensely emotional when talking about his late father. But let us start at the beginning. Because Defoe has been under pressure right from the start. ""In a crazy way, I think I enjoyed it."" At Senrab, the renowned boys' team in London that produced so many future England internationals, you had to win. By 16, West Ham had paid Charlton £1.6m for him. This is 25 years ago. ""I had not kicked a ball. If we signed a young lad at Tottenham's academy now, without wanting to put too much pressure on, I would naturally be thinking that you have to justify this fee."" Defoe did that, scoring 162 Premier League goals, ninth on the all-time list, and playing 57 times for England. Perhaps the secret was that he never stopped feeling as if he had a point to prove. ""I always felt like I had to be better than the person next to me,"" he says. ""When I speak to my friends now, they always joke about it. They say, 'your mindset was completely different to the rest of us'. They would laugh, 'you never came out. You did not drink. You always stayed behind after training.' But that is just how I was. ""I went to Rangers at the back end of my career where people could maybe understand that I was not the same player as five years before but I always felt like I had something to prove. That is not just games. That is every training session. That is every gym session."" He recalls Tony Carr, West Ham's academy boss, trying to drag him off the pitch. ""I think that came from my background, really. I knew that my family had done so much for me. I just felt like I had to give them something back. I was going to do whatever it takes."" Specifically, he is thinking of his mother. In the documentary, the only time that he becomes visibly tearful is when recalling her job cleaning toilets to help support his own dream. ""There were probably jobs that she never told me about,"" he says now. ""She had me at 18 so it was difficult for her. My mum worked around the clock just to provide but growing up in the East End all I saw around me were people working hard. My nan worked in Tate & Lyle, the sugar factory. My grandad worked in a meat factory."" He describes the events of his grandad's death through his own eyes. ""I got a knock on my door at four in the morning. I went to hospital at five. Got back home at nine. Went to White Hart Lane and played the game. I had to keep going. That was my mentality."" Loss, sadly, has been a theme in his life. Brother Gavin was killed following an assault in 2009. In 2012, he lost his father to cancer. Again, keeping going was the mantra. There were regular trips to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London throughout Euro 2012. Only now, one senses, at 41, is Defoe coming up for air. ""There were things that went on throughout my career,"" he says. ""I probably have this thing where I can blank things out. When I look back now, I don't know how I managed to play or focus and still remain positive. But at the same time you need to be resilient. I felt like I did not have time to be too emotional and sit in a corner and cry."" His relationship with his father was complicated. Curiously, Defoe has not yet seen the documentary, preferring to save it for the premiere at the end of the month. But there is a poignant scene in which an acquaintance of his father relays a tale of how he would speak with such pride about his son's achievements. ""Perhaps he did not tell him that,"" she says. ""But he told everyone else."" When this quote is put to Defoe, he takes some time to compose himself. ""I am getting emotional,"" he says. ""I always knew that he was proud, to be fair. People separate, it happens. It was just me and my mum for a long period of time. I would always see my dad at family parties and stuff but he had his own struggles. He had his own things that he had to deal with. ""Maybe at the time I did not understand it. I knew in his eyes when he spoke to me that he was proud. I knew that he wanted to be there but he had his own struggles and it was difficult. It was always good but it was in passing if that makes sense. ""We never really had the chance to sit down for hours and speak about what went on. I did not have the time to sit down and speak with my dad on a deeper level. [But] I knew."" The documentary discusses the period when Defoe believes he was going to be a father only to have a paternity test and discover that the baby was not his. It puts a different slant on his decision to move to Toronto, his mother saying that he just needed to get away. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That Bradley entered his world soon after does not feel like a coincidence. Terminally ill with neuroblastoma, the boy wanted his hero in his life. Maybe his hero needed him too. ""It is strange saying it but I just felt like I was prepared for that moment,"" says Defoe. ""But at the same time, how can you prepare for that level of love?"" He adds: ""I am 41 now so I have had experiences where it was difficult to trust people. It does make you paranoid. With Bradley, it was just completely different. From the moment that he jumped on my lap and started speaking, you could just see. It was so genuine."" Bradley died in the summer of 2017, aged six. ""He just wanted to be around me and see me every day. It puts things into perspective. I am only human. I moan about things. But there are families in situations that are really tough. It does change you as a person. But I have so many good memories of Bradley."" In 2024, Defoe is into his second season coaching within the Tottenham academy. He recalls a conversation with Joe Cole, his old pal from the centre of excellence at Lilleshall. ""He told me that I had to become a manager because I was always good with people."" It is working out for the young talent at Tottenham. Keep an eye on 16-year-old Mikey Moore. But it is working out for Defoe too. Still in football. And still with a point to prove? ""Always. Even now when I join in the sessions. I always feel like that,"" he explains. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I still get the same feeling. Not the same as playing. But I do think it is the nearest thing to playing. Being in that coaches office, planning sessions, being around the academy players. I would like to think that in five years I will be a manager. And I will be a good one."" Jermain Defoe's football journey continues. With a twist. ""When I was younger, it was just about goals. When you become older, you realise that football can give you so much more. The impact that you can have on someone's life and they can have on your life. There is so much more. It is not just about kicking a ball."""

""The replays confirm that the pass from the teammate was deliberate and that the goalkeeper has not clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, rather he miscontrolled the ball, therefore once the goalkeeper has handled the ball, it should have resulted in an indirect free-kick to Preston North End on the edge of the six-yard box.

Of the incidents examined from the second round of top-flight matches, a total of 13 errors were identified by the VAR independent review panel (IRP) - including in December's Old Firm match. The figure marks a large rise from the three mistakes found in the opening round of fixtures by the panel which is made up of former players, managers and coaches, guided by experts on the laws of the game. Crawford Allan, Scottish FA head of referee operations, told Sky Sports News: ""VAR is a process that globally football is still relatively new with. So whether it be across Europe or whether it be our colleagues south of the border we face, generally, the same challenges. ""The process works. Can we improve? Everybody can improve. Every team can get better - the teams at the top of the league want to improve, the teams at the bottom of the league want to improve. ""As I look after the referees I want to constantly improve as well because that's the objective in life, to get the best product on the pitch that we can do. ""Scotland, for having VAR for 18 months, is well in that ball park. We are quite content and comfortable but there is always room for improvement.

""For me, it's so important that our referees are allowed to make their decision on the field of play and then VAR can assist and make the decision better or correct. ""I'm here to make sure that our referees are fully supported because in Scotland we are absolutely bang on in terms of the recent results from the IRP compared to other countries that have had VAR longer than we have."" The latest SFA figures show there have been 785 VAR reviews this season and while the majority were ""silent checks"" requiring no intervention, 51 resulted in on-field reviews, while another 24 were factual overturns (offside, inside/outside penalty area). The review panel noted VAR's decision to not recommend a review of Celtic defender Alistair Johnston's handball in December's Old Firm clash was wrong. However, it was also noted there was an offside prior to the incident which would have resulted in no penalty being awarded. The fallout from that incident saw Rangers request referee Willie Collum was not put in charge of any future matches - something manager Philippe Clement recently distanced himself from. ""The process at the time as far as referees were concerned - from the on-field official and VAR - was entirely accurate at that precise moment in time,"" Allan added. ""The SFA and myself, 100 per cent we will appoint referees to games as we see fit based on their experience level and that will not change. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Every minute of the support we give to the referees is aimed at enhancing and making sure that they feel they have every opportunity to continue to enjoy the game and hopefully we can bring in new referees to the game. ""I think it is a bit unfair some of the pressure that is put on our referees. The focus on a small number of decisions versus the hundreds and thousands that they make throughout the season is disproportionate. I wouldn't want that to put off young referees because it is an enjoyable experience. ""And we want to continue to do that from a SFA perspective, to promote football and the culture of football and make sure referees enjoy it.""

44,Scottish Premiership title race: Celtic or Rangers in the driving seat?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11781/13066102/scottish-premiership-title-race-celtic-or-rangers-in-the-driving-seat,Sahil Jaidka,Publish time not found,"It has been a rollercoaster of a season so far and it is Celtic who remain in top spot - but only by the slimmest of margins. Rangers won their final game in hand - beating Ross County 3-1 at Ibrox - to draw level with Celtic on points and goal difference after 25 matches, with goals scored (57 vs 53) keeping Brendan Rodgers' side ahead. Few were predicting a closely-fought title race when Philippe Clement replaced Michael Beale at Rangers in mid-October. He inherited a squad that was bereft of confidence, struggling in Europe and in many people's minds out of the title race. Celtic had stretched the gap to 10 points at one stage of the season but a 16-game unbeaten run under the Belgian saw Rangers cut that deficit to just five, with games in hand. Just before the turn of the year, the champions responded with a 2-1 win over their Old Firm rivals and Rodgers' side were eight points clear at the summit heading into 2024. Stream the Scottish Premiership & more with NOW Get Sky Sports Scottish Premiership on Sky Sports Scottish Premiership free highlights Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But Rangers still had two games in hand and beat Hibernian in the first of them following the winter break before Celtic dropped points at Aberdeen. Clement's side then saw off Ross County to move level with the Hoops in a title race that is set to go the distance. If only football was that simple! A few months ago, the answer was Celtic but now it really is impossible to call. The Hoops are still in the driving seat by virtue of having scored more goals than their rivals - it really is all to play for. Both clubs have eight league games to navigate before the split, including another Old Firm clash. Celtic have shown - despite occasional frustration in the stands and their advantage slowly being eaten away - they can deliver big results when the going gets tough. Rangers, meanwhile, have proven they are also in this race for the long haul, with the belief at Ibrox growing. However, as well as form, other factors come into the equation. The mentality to get over the line in a title race, playing in Glasgow's goldfish bowl and inevitable squad issues through injuries or suspension - a lot can change. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Over the last 12 seasons, Celtic have won the league 11 times with Rangers claiming just one in 2020/21 as they stopped their rivals clinching a 10th consecutive title. Several members of Rodgers' squad know what it takes to get over the line, as does the manager himself, having won back-to-back league titles during his first spell in Glasgow, including an invincible treble. At first glance, league tables in recent years, such as 2022, may suggest there have been some close battles for Scotland's top spot. However, in reality, that title was sewn up comfortably and you need to go back to 2010/11 for the last genuine title race when Rangers were crowned champions on the last day of the season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Chris Sutton: ""There has been a mentality shift. You can see it. The longer Clement has been manager at the club, the belief has grown and it is getting stronger and stronger. ""There's been a very obvious momentum swing since Clement's arrival at Rangers. He's building a team that is gathering belief with every week. ""Celtic have been inconsistent this season. That has been their biggest problem."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Kris Boyd: ""This title race is going to go all the way. ""Clement talks about turning up at Ibrox and everyone has a smile on their face. Everyone is expecting to win football matches at Rangers and the fans are right behind the team. They feel something is brewing. ""They had a bump in the road when they went to Celtic Park and got beat, but they got back on the horse and have gone again.""It all comes down to one thing and that is winning games of football. When that happens, that is when the smiles come. ""There's going to be a lot of chopping and changing between now and the end of the season. Twists and turns are going to happen, but the good thing for Scottish football is we've got a title race and we've not had it for a while. ""Celtic have ran away with it for years and Rangers ran away with it when they won it. I don't think it's the best Old Firm teams that we've seen, but we're going to have excitement between now and the end of the season."" Celtic and Rangers have eight league games to go before the league splits into a top and bottom half after April 13 for five final matches. On top of that, there is a Scottish Cup quarter-final for both to fit in, plus Europa League knockout action for Rangers - it is going to be a busy run-in. All eyes will be on Ibrox on April 7 when the two clubs meet in the third Old Firm clash of the season - live on Sky Sports. Celtic boast a 100 per cent record in the fixture this season, a run Rangers must end if they are to boost their chances of winning the title. An injury-hit Hoops side were victorious against Beale's Rangers at Ibrox in September before Kyogo was the difference-maker again, helping claim a 2-1 win on December 30 in Glasgow's East End. As things stand there will be nothing between the teams the next time Celtic and Rangers meet, but the Old Firm know they must take care of matters in the games that precede the Ibrox clash - with one more league meeting set to follow after the split. You might think it means pride here - and yes there is that. However, Champions League football is also up for grabs with this season's league winners guaranteed a group-stage spot and big prize money: at least £35m. However, due to the UEFA coefficient rankings, it could be the last season an automatic spot is up for grabs for Scottish clubs for some time. That is because Scotland are currently in a battle to finish 10th in UEFA's rankings - which impacts clubs in the 2025/26 campaign. Then from 2026/27 there could be no automatic places, plenty of tricky qualifiers and a huge dent in cash available for clubs to strengthen and compete in Europe. It is all to play for but it takes a certain mentality to win the league. Rangers' form has got them back into the race but you cannot underplay the experience Rodgers and his squad have. It really is too close to call. You can now start receiving messages and alerts for the latest breaking sports news, analysis, in-depth features and videos from our dedicated WhatsApp channel!

46,Burnley 2-2 Fulham: David Datro Fofana's late double earns Clarets dramatic draw,https://www.skysports.com/football/burnley-vs-fulham/report/482815,Ron Walker,Publish time not found,"Super sub David Datro Fofana was Burnley's hero as the Chelsea loanee struck twice to earn the Clarets a last-minute 2-2 draw against Fulham at Turf Moor. The Cottagers looked set to raise the pressure on Vincent Kompany, whose side were booed off at half-time, after dominating for much of the game and racing into a two-goal lead inside 21 minutes through Joao Palhinha and Rodrigo Muniz. Only the introduction of home debutant Fofana, shortly after the hour mark, finally sparked the hosts into life. It took him only seven minutes to give them hope, nodding Lorenz Assignon's cross into an empty net. That belief turned to reality in added time when he bundled Wilson Odobert's low cross over the line from close-range, to earn the Clarets a valuable point despite conceding first - something they had not managed previously all season. Burnley's point keeps them seven points from safety owing to Luton's draw at Newcastle, while Fulham's poor form now extends to a run of one win in seven matches. Burnley: Trafford (7), Assignon (6), O'Shea (6), Ekdal (5), Vitinho (5), Brownhill (5), Berge (7), Ramsey (6), Odobert (7), Foster (6), Amdouni (5).



Subs: Esteve (6), Fofana (8), Gudmundsson (6), Bruun Larsen, Massengo (n/a).



Fulham: Leno (5), Castagne (6), Adarabioyo (6), Ream (7), Robinson (7), Reed (6), Palhinha (7), De Cordova-Reid (5), Pereira (7), Willian (7), Muniz (7).



Subs: Broja (6), Cairney (6), Tete (n/a).



Man of the match: David Datro Fofana. Burnley had enjoyed one of English football's quirkier records coming into the game, with their last home defeat against Fulham coming back in 1951. But that 73-year hoodoo looked under real threat with barely a quarter of an hour gone, when the first attack of note was glanced home by Palhinha at the near post from a pinpoint Andreas Pereira corner. Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App It felt like a familiar tale to see the Clarets starting brightly before paying the price for a defensive lapse. That deja vu only became stronger once Antonee Robinson's hopeful ball forward beat the offside trap and found Muniz, whose first-time lob was too much for James Trafford to keep out. Odobert's narrow far-post miss was the only hint Burnley produced of a comeback before the break, leaving Kompany to endure the jeers of his home support at the interval. A third goal would have surely secured a much-needed victory for Fulham after the break, and Burnley were indebted to the form of Trafford for twice keeping out Willian as well as a Tosin Adarabioyo header and a stinging Muniz effort. It owed more to an singular moment of quality than any shift in momentum that afforded Burnley hope of a comeback, with a crisp counter-attack following a Fulham corner worked quickly to Assignon, whose cross was misjudged by Bernd Leno and nodded into an unguarded net by Fofana. That still did little to shift the dial, with Fulham seemingly comfortable to see out a one-goal advantage. But at that point, it only needed another moment to prove decisive, and so it proved. Odobert's fine play down the flank saw him get past Timothy Castagne and into space, before he dug out a low cross which was turned home by Fofana on the slide to secure a dream home debut for the 21-year-old, and finally bring some belief back to Turf Moor. Burnley manager Vincent Kompany on David Fofana's impact: ""I think that was a turning point for us, the performance of Fofana, the performance of Maxime Esteve, the performance of Assignon and the other players who came off the bench, that was a turning point for us. ""We have to have this week-in, week-out. We can use any help we can get and David showed today that he gives us something different and we will need it. ""I've not spent one second talking with him about what he did in the Premier League or with Chelsea. But he's played in the Bundesliga, which is a very, very tough league and he's a player that comes back with a wealth of experience."" Fulham manager Marco Silva:  ""There is frustration of course in our dressing room at the way we lost two points this afternoon. Until the moment they scored for 2-1 we are the best team in the pitch. We could have made it 3-0 instead of 2-1 but for their exceptional goalkeeper who kept them in the game. ""We lost two points because they punished the mistakes, it's not the first time it has happened. ""You have to be stronger at this level. If you make mistakes of course you are punished. For 70 minutes we played so well but you cannot switch off and be naive like we were."" Burnley visit Liverpool at Anfield next Saturday in the Premier League; kick-off 3pm.

Villa scored four first-half goals in an 18-minute blitz to become the first team to hit four or more goals in the opening 30 minutes of a Premier League away game since October 2011. Villa captain John McGinn put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before Ollie Watkins doubled the lead four minutes later as he finished off Douglas Luiz's wonderful through ball, which Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp labelled ""one of the best passes you could ever see"". Sheff Utd: Foderingham (5); Bogle (5), Holgate (5), Ahmedhodzic (5), Trusty (5), Norrington-Davies (5); McAtee (5), Souza (6), Brooks (5), Diaz (6); Osula (5).

Man of the match: Ollie Watkins. Leon Bailey curled in a third in the 20th minute followed by Youri Tielemans' thunderous strike off the underside of the bar to leave some home fans heading for the exits after just half an hour, while those remaining unsurprisingly booed their side off at half-time. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Blades' problems then deepened just 90 seconds into the second half as Alex Moreno fired in a fifth to make it five different players on the scoresheet for Villa. Sheffield United's misery was compounded late on when they were denied a late stoppage-time consolation goal by VAR as Vinicius Souza's goal was disallowed for offside. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is a second humiliating defeat of the season for Sheffield United having been drubbed 8-0 by Newcastle in September, with Chris Wilder's side now 10 points adrift of safety at the bottom while they have conceded 59 goals after 23 games, the most of any side at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1965/66. Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Meanwhile, Villa took full advantage of Tottenham's lunchtime draw at Everton to move above Spurs into fourth and go five points behind leaders Liverpool. Villa's biggest away win in the Premier League since April 2008, when they beat Derby County 6-0 at Pride Park, began in the 12th minute as Luiz released Watkins who chipped over Wes Foderingham onto the post before McGinn followed up into an empty net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But Watkins was not to be denied a goal as he doubled the lead four minutes later latching onto Luiz's stunning outside-of-the-boot pass to fire low across Foderingham. Watkins then turned provider as he slipped in Bailey who drove into the box and cut in on his left foot to unleash a devastating curling finish to make it 3-0 after 20 minutes. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Villa's four-goal flourish was complete in the 30th minute as Tielemans hammered in off the woodwork from a corner to leave the home fans fearing a repeat of the 8-0 loss to Newcastle. Wilder's half-time team talk had no effect as the Blades conceded just 90 seconds into the second half as Watkins provided a fine cross for Moreno to volley home from close range. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Villa had VAR to thank for their clean sheet as Souza's 91st-minute goal was ruled out for offside.

""They were clinical in taking their chances but we were open and I have to accept that responsibility in terms of the way the team was set up. We have to take our medicine. This is what the Premier League is about, this is what it can do to you. ""It is not a nice feeling, there is no hiding place for a manager - whether I'm stood in that technical area for 95 minutes [which] felt like about three weeks - and for the players out there. ""Now everything that gets chucked at us - from our supporters, from the media, from everybody's opinion - we have to take on the chin and accept. ""It's been a really poor day for us and as manager I'm the face and front and centre of it all, and I have to take that responsibility."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aston Villa boss Unai Emery to Sky Sports: ""We reacted very well after the match we played on Tuesday [3-1 home defeat to Newcastle]. We were focused. ""We controlled the game and were clinical. We were feeling comfortable and stronger. Asked whether he would have liked to have scored more goals: ""I want to win and to respect the opponent is to try to continue to play seriously. ""The result at the end, scoring goals is important but the most important thing is to play serious."" Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""I don't always agree with the predictor (see above) but that's right. Sheffield United don't have the quality. It's about building confidence, putting performances together, show that you're really willing for the fans. ""I thought Chris Wilder made a really good point. Sometimes when fans watch games and they say, 'They don't care, they're not trying and running hard enough'. It's not the case, it's just your confidence is so low.

Everything has become really difficult for them. ""They're lower than a snake's belly right now. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel for them. They tried to change it with Chris coming in, but it hasn't made a difference because the players haven't really got the quality. ""You look at Luton and see a direction. Pace, energy, they get the ball in the box, they're direct. But I look at Sheffield United and struggle to see what sort of team they are."" If defending is an artform, Sheffield United have produced crimes against it this season. This latest walloping at the hands of an Aston Villa, who should've been vulnerable after a midweek 3-1 home defeat to Newcastle, means the Blades have now shipped 59 Premier League goals in 23 goals. That average of 2.56 goals shipped per game means this Blades defence is officially the worst defence in Premier League history, at this stage of the season. No team have conceded more after 23 games. The underlying metrics back up that stark record. The Blades have faced the most shots (390) and have the highest expected goals against (46.07) figure this season. Any momentum gained by appointing club legend Chris Wilder has evaporated into the abyss. He hasn't helped himself at times either in the search for cohesion in his backline. In nine Premier League games in charge, he's named six different defensive line-ups. He doesn't know his best XI - and neither did his predecessor Paul Heckingbottom.

48,Aston Villa 1-2 Man Utd: Scott McTominay's late winner blows race for Champions League football wide open,https://www.skysports.com/football/a-villa-vs-man-utd/report/482821,Sam Blitz,Publish time not found,"Scott McTominay's late winner earned Manchester United a first away league victory against a top-nine side under Erik ten Hag, as Aston Villa were beaten 2-1 to blow the race for Champions League football wide open. In-form United started fast at Villa Park and took a deserved lead through Rasmus Hojlund's fifth goal in five Premier League games. Villa dominated the big chances but found Andre Onana in inspired form, with the United goalkeeper making four big saves, including two from Ollie Watkins. The pressure eventually told as Douglas Luiz fired home from Leon Bailey's cross with over 20 minutes to go - but United had the last laugh. Substitute McTominay headed Diogo Dalot's first-time cross in from close range with four minutes of normal time to play to earn United a precious three points, which moves them within five points of fifth-placed Villa. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a massive win for us,"" said Ten hag to Sky Sports after the game. ""We get closer and that's the aim for today, that was absolutely our target and we did it. The way we did it, I liked it. ""I never think negative scenarios. I think positive.

""There is much room for improvement, if we do this and there are more games to play, let's see where it goes."" Villa controlled the first-half possession but United looked dangerous on the break early on. Bruno Fernandes fed Hojlund in the penalty area only for the striker to sky his close-range effort, while Alejandro Garnacho blasted a long-range effort wide. Then came the opening goal as Fernandes' corner found Harry Maguire - who had escaped Boubacar Kamara's clutches - at the far post, leaving the onside Hojlund the simple task of tapping home. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Villa's response to the early setback was excellent. John McGinn forced an acrobatic tip over from United goalkeeper Onana, who was also equal to Watkins' one-on-one inside the box as the hosts opened up Ten Hag's side in a sweeping move. Jacob Ramsey, who had a bright game in midfield, then put an effort from inside the box wide as Villa ended the opening period strongly. Man Utd took the influential Luke Shaw off at half-time due to injury and it took just three minutes for replacement Victor Lindelof to make a big error. The Swede gifted the ball to Matty Cash deep in the United half and he squared to Watkins who looked certain to score - but once again hit Onana. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ramsey had two more chances, failing to trap Bailey's incisive pass for a one-on-one, before seeing a low shot blocked by Dalot on the line. Eventually, the pressure told. Onana made another point-blank save from Clement Lenglet from a corner but, after United cleared, Bailey put the ball back in the mixer for Luiz to fire high into the net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  United tried to respond straight away as Garnacho fired wide of the near post after a mazy run - but Villa stepped back on the throttle. Luiz had a big chance following Dalot's poor clearance but the midfielder failed to make a big connection. Substitute Moussa Diaby then curled over as Villa looked dangerous on the counter-attack. Back came United as Garnacho fired straight at Emiliano Martinez after another solo run. But United's late winner came from a familiar source. Dalot's instinctive cross was headed home by McTominay from close-range, which could be a massive goal in the context of the top-four race.

51,Blackburn Rovers 3-1 Stoke City: Tyrhys Dolan scores twice as John Eustace wins first game in charge at Ewood Park,https://www.skysports.com/football/blackburn-vs-stoke/report/485062,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Tyrhys Dolan's double helped Blackburn begin their new era with a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Stoke to ease their relegation worries. After a turbulent week that saw John Eustace replace Jon Dahl Tomasson as head coach, Blackburn put in an encouraging display, epitomised by scoring three goals in the first 37 minutes. Dolan converted a seventh-minute opener from close range before Sammie Szmodics headed in his 22nd of the campaign 13 minutes later. Dolan's composed finish seemingly put the game beyond Stoke, but Niall Ennis marked his full debut after his deadline-day move from Blackburn by scoring his first for the club before half-time. Daniel Johnson spurned a glorious chance early in the second half as his poor penalty was saved and, despite Stoke's possession, Rovers' defence deprived the visitors of any real opportunities to win their first league game since mid-December. Steven Schumacher made eight changes for this clash but it made no difference in a woeful first half where the game was lost and Stoke are two places and three points above the drop zone after a fourth straight defeat. Dolan gave the new era lift off in the seventh minute, but the architect was Callum Brittain whose sumptuous first-time cross put the chance on a plate for him to slot home from six yards at the far post, and Sam Gallagher went close to doubling the advantage in the 14th minute but slotted just wide. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Stoke failed to learn their lesson and were further behind in the 20th minute after Brittain was again given time to superbly cross and Ryan Hedges nodded across goal for Szmodics to thump his header into the roof of the net. The away supporters were irate after Rovers scored a simple third in the 37th minute when a long ball was flicked on by Gallagher, sending Dolan racing clear on the right with just Daniel Iversen to beat and he made no mistake, burying his shot into the left corner. Stoke had hope two minutes later when Bae Jun-ho's flick-on found Ennis in the area and he showed excellent composure to step inside his man and find the left corner. It gave the visitors some impetus and they carved out a golden opportunity to reduce the deficit further just after the break when Brittain hauled down Andre Vidigal in the area. Johnson stepped up to take the penalty but Aynsley Pears guessed the right way and saved before Rovers cleared. The visitors were in the ascendency and Ben Wilmot shot straight at Pears, but Blackburn displayed defensive solidity that has been missing to expertly see the game out. Blackburn first team coach Damien Johnson: ""I'm not going to lie, it feels good. It's been a difficult couple of days. Great credit to the players. It's not easy for them but I thought they were outstanding today. ""Their concentration, their application, how they went about it, the togetherness they showed as you could see towards the end, was superb, so great credit to them. ""They did lots of good things. I think we showed two sides of the game today. Lots of good things in the first half and then we dug in. ""We knew that we'd find space on transition so there was an element of allowing Stoke to come onto us. I think at times in the game we could look after the ball better but when you've had a run of results like this, the important thing is you get three points."" Stoke's Steven Schumacher: ""The start is just not good enough. If you give a Championship team a 3-0 head start, then you're doomed, because they don't really have to do anything else in the game. ""That's kind of what we did. We didn't start the game well enough. They scored goals that were too easy to score and gave ourselves a mountain to climb. ""From the third goal onwards, I thought we looked better, we looked like a team. We were positive, we passed the ball forwards which we didn't do up until they scored the third goal, and we won some tackles and some duels which is the bare minimum. ""We've got to show a bit more character, a bit more belief, a bit more bravery. More importantly, we've got to show a bit more fight.""

52,"Middlesbrough 1-2 Bristol City: Jason Knight, Matty James seal Robins win",https://www.skysports.com/football/mboro-vs-bristol-c/report/485068,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Two goals in two first-half minutes earned Bristol City a 2-1 win at Middlesbrough - their first of 2024 in the Sky Bet Championship. Jason Knight's cool finish in the 16th minute was followed by Matty James' drive in off the woodwork as Boro failed to get going. Bristol City's first league win since Boxing Day was enough to lift Liam Manning's side level on points with the Teessiders in mid-table. Middlesbrough did create chances and Samuel Silvera made things interesting in the closing seconds by pulling one back, without knowing much about it. But head coach Michael Carrick had to suffer another defeat, with Boro having won only one of their last seven home league games. They have also picked up just five points from the last available 15. Even though the Robins - who came through 120 minutes of FA Cup football against Nottingham Forest in midweek - had not won since Boxing Day, they were quick to make an impression. George Tanner had already volleyed into the arms of goalkeeper Tom Glover, who had also done well to dive to his right to deny Harry Cornick from hitting the opener soon after. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp The only time Middlesbrough threatened during the first half was when Hayden Hackney failed to bring the ball down quickly enough when he was picked out at the back post by Luke Ayling. And City's quickfire double came along shortly after. Defender Rob Dickie picked out Knight with an incisive through pass. With just Glover to beat, Knight turned and spun away from the goalkeeper and Lukas Engel before finding the empty net. Within two minutes Bristol City were two up. Highly-rated Hackney was at fault for gifting possession to James and the visitors' captain fired in off the post from 20 yards. Hackney tried to make amends 14 minutes later when his effort from 25 yards curled away from the far post, with goalkeeper Max O'Leary diving to cover. But City should have been three up before the break. Cornick's excellent run and pass from inside his own half put Sam Bell clear. Rather than round Glover, Bell tried to beat him with a shot and the goalkeeper was big enough to thwart. That was followed by an O'Leary low save at the other end from Finn Azaz. O'Leary had to be alert to make a strong save from Greenwood at the start of the second half after he had been picked out by Azaz in the box. The Bristol City keeper made an even better save soon after by rushing off his line to deny Greenwood, who had been played in behind by Azaz. Marcus Forss also drilled an effort on the turn narrowly wide. Middlesbrough tried different things but Manning's men defended well. O'Leary also had to make another strong save to stop Rav van den Berg's 25-yard drive from flying in. Greenwood thought he had scored with 12 minutes to go only for the officials to rule it out for a very close offside call. Middlesbrough did pull one back in stoppage-time when Azaz's shot hit the back of substitute Silvera before bouncing in but it proved too little, too late. Middlesbrough's Michael Carrick:  ""I thought there was enough in the game for us to get something. In the end we didn't start particularly well, we didn't start like us and paid the price. ""Those two quick goals gave them a massive start in the game. My players showed character and ended up playing good football, it just didn't go for us. In the end it was too much. ""We finished the first half with good signs, the boys looked like themselves and we carried that on. I still thought we looked a threat, we just didn't end up finishing it off. ""I have belief in the boys, there is s still a lot of good things going on in the game. I know they are capable of taking the chances. We have to believe it will turn."" Bristol City's Liam Manning: ""We had six changes from Wednesday and the lads put in so much to Wednesday, so we needed everybody. ""The fact we found a way to win in a variety of ways is something to learn from. I made two changes early second half too because I felt energy was going to be important. ""We played 120 minutes on Wednesday, plus the travel, it has been a relentless programme for us. We came here with no excuses and you have to max out. I enjoyed it. ""The first half plan worked. The players did a terrific job in implementing it. ""We knew they would have a lot of possession and we were happy to give them it in front of us. We did an excellent job of counter attacking. ""We did an outstanding job of competing, we had blocked shots and crosses, we showed a great togetherness second half. ""They had very few chances really. I was pleased with the second half for different reasons."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."
53,Kylian Mbappe: Mikel Arteta says Arsenal have to be in the conversation to sign PSG forward but hints Real Madrid move is likely,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13072839/kylian-mbappe-mikel-arteta-says-arsenal-have-to-be-in-the-conversation-to-sign-psg-forward-but-hints-real-madrid-move-is-likely,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Mikel Arteta says his Arsenal side have to be in the conversation to sign PSG forward Kylian Mbappe this summer - but acknowledged the France international is likely to join Real Madrid. Mbappe told PSG this week he will leave the club at the end of this season, with the French club expecting the forward to join Real once the terms of his exit are finalised. The 25-year-old has also been linked to the Premier League and Arteta says Arsenal need to be involved in discussions to sign the player. ""When there is a player of that calibre, we always have to be in that conversation,"" he told his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Burnley. ""But it looks in a different way, that's what I would say."" PSG manager Luis Enrique declined to comment on the news when he spoke to reporters on Friday, saying: ""No. I can't say anything."" He was then asked if he was worried about the player's commitment for the rest of the season, but made it clear this was not a topic up for discussion. Mbappe to leave PSG this summer Who will decide Mbappe's next move? Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines ""I am going to try to bring this topic to an end. I don't have any comments to make,"" he said. ""The parties involved haven't yet said anything publicly, Kylian Mbappe hasn't said anything publicly. When both parties speak, I will give my opinion."" Sky Sports' data editor Adam Smith: Many believe Arsenal cannot win the Premier League this season without a 30-goal-a-season striker. So would Mbappe provide the goals needed to make the Gunners serial Premier League winners? Well, Arsenal's title chances would jump eight per cent - from 11 per cent to 19 per cent - if the Gunners signed Mbappe at the start of next season, according to leading sports intelligence agency Twenty First Group (TFG). The data wizards also project the 25-year-old would score between 28 and 32 goals in the Premier League during the 2024/25 campaign, based on his historical conversion rate in Ligue 1 and Arsenal's expected goals. The data model suggests Mbappe would become the second-best striker in the Premier League, behind only Erling Haaland, and the third best in Europe, behind Haaland and Harry Kane. In terms of transfer value, TFG estimates Mbappe would cost £117m with one year remaining on his contract, rising to £132m with two years and £150m with three years. PSG and Mbappe - who is out of contract this summer - still need to negotiate whether he will leave for a fee or sacrifice his own earnings. PSG have Mbappe's word that he will never leave on a free transfer. Real Madrid hold a long-term interest in Mbappe, who would have to take a pay cut to join the Spanish side, even though they are prepared to make him the highest-paid player in their history. PSG turned down a €220m (£188m) offer for Mbappe from Real Madrid in August 2021. The forward then chose to sign a new three-year deal with PSG that expires this summer. If Mbappe were to extend his deal by a further year, PSG would value him at €150m (£128m) in the upcoming transfer window. They accepted a €300m (£256m) from Saudi club Al Hilal last summer, which Mbappe turned down. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: ""Mbappe costs PSG an absolute fortune, in the region of £180m a year when you factor in his wages and bonuses. There's a sense of relief that this whole circus is going to be over and their future is going to move in a different direction. ""Everybody knows Real Madrid want to sign him. He's been in talks with the for a long time because since January he's been able to talk to other clubs as he's out of contract this summer. ""Our information is, Real are prepared to make him the highest-paid player in history but there is no way a club even as big as Real can afford to pay him the kind of money he was earning at PSG."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Spanish football expert Alvaro Montero: ""Inside the club, everyone is positive, especially Florentino Perez and Jose Angel Sanchez. They are the ones who know what is going to happen. They believe in March or April that Mbappe will tell the club - not publicly - where he is going to play. ""Everybody inside the club believes he is going to play for Real Madrid but let's see what happens, especially in the next weeks. ""At Real Madrid, the player that earns the most is on €24m [£20m] per year. Real, it has been reported, could offer him €25m [£21m] after tax, so around €50m [£43m] before tax. ""Inside Real Madrid they believe that the amount of money Kylian has earned in the last two or three years is down in part to the famous £200m bid Real Madrid made to sign him before he signed a contract extension at PSG. ""The club believe that the money he has earned, in part, is thanks to Real Madrid's offer that was rejected by PSG.""

54,Stoke City 0-5 Leicester City: Patson Daka and Jamie Vardy score brace apiece in Foxes thumping,https://www.skysports.com/football/stoke-vs-leicester/report/485058,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Leicester extended their lead at the top of the Championship to 11 points with a thumping 5-0 victory at Stoke. Patson Daka and Jamie Vardy both scored twice, including a penalty each, to inspire the Foxes to a comprehensive victory. The in-form Daka opened the scoring and Kasey McAteer doubled the visitors' advantage shortly before the half-hour mark. After the break a first penalty of the afternoon for Leicester allowed Daka to net his second, his ninth goal involvement in his last eight matches. An evergreen Jamie Vardy came off the bench to complete the rout, firing in his first goals in the league since November. Stoke offered little resistance against the table-toppers, with their winless home run extended to nine games, dating back to October. Unbeaten in eight meetings with the Potters, a rampant Leicester started on the front foot. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports The returning Abdul Fatawu, who had missed three games through suspension, flashed a venomous effort just wide in an early threat to the hosts. Stoke failed to heed the warning, with a McAteer header forcing a smart acrobatic stop from Jack Bonham and Daka heading over from close range. And Enzo Maresca's side were soon rewarded, with the Daka adding the finishing touch to a slick attacking move. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's delicate delivery was headed back across goal invitingly by Fatawu, with the Zambia international firing into an empty net. The Potters then had a glorious opportunity for an immediate leveller, but Tyrese Campbell's drilled effort was saved by the feet of Mads Hermansen. Instead Leicester tightened their grip on the game as an ambitious McAteer effort from range deflected wickedly off Ben Wilmot and flew beyond a wrong-footed and helpless Bonham. Steven Schumacher tried to revitalise the hosts with a string of changes after the interval, but Leicester did not let up. When Wout Faes' buccaneering run was halted in the area, Daka converted from 12 yards for a sixth goal in his last eight outings, either side of his trip to the Africa Cup of Nations. It was the forward's last piece of action for the day, but his replacement Vardy soon picked up the mantle. The 37-year-old former England international finished first time from a glorious James Justin delivery and added a second from the penalty spot deep into stoppage time. Stoke nearly added a consolation, but a Hermansen double save thwarted both Bae Jun-ho and Wilmot, capping off a dismal afternoon for the hosts. But it was another day to remember for Leicester, who took another step closer to an immediate return to the Premier League. Stoke's Steven Schumacher: ""We were miles off it and they were just too good for us. ""They showed today why they're top of the league. They've done everything properly, but they didn't have to work hard at all. ""We didn't have the belief or the quality. We tried, but they had too much for us and their goals were too easy. ""We knew we were coming up the best team, this result wasn't going to determine the outcome of the rest of the season, but the next two might do. ""I need to make sure that we respond and put in a better performance and try to get a win. ""It's three games now with three defeats and we need to do something about it, so Blackburn's going to be a big game at the weekend. ""We need to get the players ready for it. We have to react and we won't go away and sulk. ""There's a real lack of confidence at home. When things go against us or there's a little adversity, the crowd turns against us and it affects the players. ""We have to work hard to try and change that now."" Leicester's Enzo Maresca: ""The most important thing for me is the way that the team is getting better. ""I don't like it when people hurt the players, because I know the effort that they're doing to bring this club back to the Premier League. ""Since the start, I see the way that they're working and I know that they're doing everything they can. ""If some of the fans aren't sure or convinced, it doesn't matter to me. The performance was very good today and that experience will make us better. ""I'm very happy with the result and the clean sheet, especially with the first half-an-hour, that was very good and we played the way that we like to play. ""The last 10 minutes of the first half, we conceded two yellow cards that we needed to avoid as it could compromise the game, but that was it. ""We're very happy and when we play away, the environment is always nice and the players and fans together enjoy the moment. ""I've said many times, our fans are unbelievable. At home some of them maybe aren't convinced, but it is what it is. ""It's important for us to have lots of options and every time we need them, they help, so we're very happy.""

Real Madrid are another club going through the same process with the Santiago Bernabeu and in England, Liverpool are continuing to make improvements to Anfield. Those projects come in comparison to Everton, who are building a brand new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock. Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, believes the model adopted by the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the future of stadium design, suggesting Manchester United's Old Trafford could be a candidate for renovation in the future in the same vein as the Camp Nou, particularly with sustainability in mind. He said: ""At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums. ""I know why Everton moved but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset. ""First, you need to look long and hard at why you cannot upgrade that as the starting point,"" he added. ""There are so many positives to that and for many English clubs in the future that will be their starting point, and it should be. ""You can get everything you need by doing that and also you can save a lot of carbon by doing so."" Another key part of the evolution of stadium design is the ability for an arena to be reconfigured and used for more than one purpose, hosting multiple sports and event types. For example, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium it is not uncommon to see football one weekend, American football the following weekend, a music concert in midweek and later this year you'll even see a karting track at the stadium, which will be set up perfectly for each individual event. Chris Lee, who is the managing director of global design firm Populous, who were the architects and lead designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, will have seen this change first hand from his involvement with the Emirates Stadium project and then as project director of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Not only do these events allow a club to increase their revenue and bring a wider programme of events that can be enjoyed by spectators, but it also provides a more sustainable stadium that can be enjoyed for many years by a huge number of people. For new stadiums all over the world, being multi-functional with, for example, moving pitches and a retractable roof to help facilitate multi-use design, is a top priority. Lee said: ""From a societal perspective, having these big venues sitting in the middle of our communities where they are important but then being able to be used literally seven days a week, whether it is your local football team, rugby, NFL or concerts, I think that is really important from many perspectives. ""From an architect's and designer's perspective, being able to reconfigure space is really exciting. We now have the technology to be able to have huge bits of buildings literally moving to be able to reconfigure them, so they are all perfect. ""We tried this as architects in the 60s. We saw great visionary stadiums like the Aloha in Hawaii where stands moved or roofs moved, never particularly successfully, but now I think we are at a point where we have engineering technology where we can genuinely reconfigure buildings. ""Every stadium and every location is different,"" he added. ""But we have to work with our clubs and our partners to see how we can accommodate the multi-use piece, but accommodate it so it is perfect. ""If you looked at Tottenham, it was designed clearly as the perfect stadium for Spurs. Premier League football was at the heart of it, but it is also really the first bespoke NFL stadium built outside of the continental US. ""Sightlines work, locker rooms work, everything works, and when you go in there for a Tottenham game to an NFL exhibition game, it's a different venue. It feels different, it looks different and works perfectly for both codes."" There was a trend, particularly in America, for stadiums to be pushed to the outskirts of towns and cities. However modern stadiums have moved back into the heart of their communities. The stadiums are now the centre piece of the local community and are a hub of activity all year round. It can also lead to a regeneration of the area as improvements are made to the local facilities and transport links in the area, benefitting the whole community. An example is Fulham's new Riverside Stand - designed by Populous - which will not only increase Craven Cottage's capacity by 3,000 seats to 28,000, but will also house restaurants, bars, a hotel, health club, and conference and event spaces. The project will also see a riverside walkway open that will help provide community amenities on matchdays and non-matchdays, and also allow the public to walk along the banks of the Thames between Hammersmith and Putney bridges for the first time. ""When we look at our cities, particularly in the UK and around Europe, our cities grew up around these buildings,"" Lee said. ""They are part of our fabric and part of our daily lives. The game on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, the circus comes into town and the stadium changes. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think it is important the stadiums stay in our communities. If we looked in the 70s and 80s, there was a move on an urban planning level to say these buildings are bad neighbours and we'll push them to the edges of the cities. ""In America, cities moving their stadiums to the outskirts and surrounding them by literally acres of black top car parking was the norm and then in the 90s, and actually with a baseball stadium we did in Baltimore at Camdens Yard, it was to help the clubs and the stadium are actually good neighbours and they are good regenerators. ""A key part of the future will be how we can move stadiums sensitively back into our cities, keep them there and then bring the life, the fans and the regeneration that spills out from them into our local communities."" Heverin also believes stadium design should be and will be pushed in the future to come up with new ways to involve the communities. He said: ""We should be pushed to think of more interesting ways to involve the community. ""We have a project where we've looked at a ground concourse that could also work as a market. You can set up stalls in the concourse and really use the space as a covered market out of matchdays. ""It's a really interesting way to look at the concourse, a more public way rather than just for those who pay a certain amount of money, for example to use conference facilities."" Heverin is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green Rovers. Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue. The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as ""the world's first timber stadium."" Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts. ""The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,"" he said. ""Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else. ""There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero. ""The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,"" he added. ""For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles. ""When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain. ""It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too. ""I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch."" For Barcelona, sustainability played a part in their decision to upgrade the Camp Nou, along with what the new campus can bring to the surrounding neighbourhoods around the stadium. Alex Barbany, head of business development of the Espai Barca project told Sky Sports: ""In the current times, sustainability is a given. You cannot just go ahead with a project like this without giving thought to sustainability. ""At Camp Nou, we are preserving the first two tiers and building the third from scratch. One hundred per cent of the gravel is being recycled, 50 per cent of it will be recycled into our own project and the other will be used for other projects across the city after we reached an agreement with the town hall. ""We are paying special attention to delivering solar panels on the roof so we can use renewable energy for our own consumption in the building. ""Sustainability has to be the norm all over the world. The fact we are renovating the stadium and not demolishing it and building it as brand new, that makes us feel proud."" Barcelona, who enjoy a huge number of visitors to the club, are equally proud of the part their new facilities will play as they look to make their campus more ""relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community"" with site that will have a constant stream events all year round. Barbany said: ""There are very few stadiums around the world that sit at the heart of a global capital city like Barcelona, which has a huge touristic graphic and flow. ""There are very few of those and new projects which are being built in such sizeable and central locations of an international appeal like Barcelona. ""If you add on top of that the strength and the quality of the brand of Barca, that sort of sizeable, central location within a city like Barcelona, we believe it makes it truly unique. ""Having the luxury of the central location and the flexibility and land around the stadium is making it possible to do what we are doing. That is what is enabling us to deliver that community element and make the neighbourhood and the city truly become part of it, especially beyond matchday. ""On non-matchdays, roughly 95 per cent of the traffic on campus is from tourists and visitors. One of our main challenges is to become much more relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community so they are just not thinking about us on a matchday but to have rotating content which makes the Camp Nou and the arena relevant, in terms of entertainment options on any given day or weekend. ""You don't always have the opportunity in your lifetime to reshape the largest stadium in the world and to develop a brand new campus in the city centre of a city like Barcelona, which pretty much everyone in the world knows what it is and where it is. ""This will be the true legacy of this club for the next generations, and that is what keeps everyone so excited about the project."" Head of Business Development of Espai Barça Project Alex Barbany:


“It’s always the dilemma for a club like ours.
“We have 100 millions fans all over the place and obviously it is really hard for many of them to come over to Barcelona and enjoy the live experience.


“It’s definitely one of the main challenges for the industry.


“The fans around the world are connecting with us through social media, and that is the channel where we get the most interaction with our fans, but at the moment we don’t have the right products to engage with them and to monetise it yet.” Barcelona are also looking to the future, revealing the Camp Nou upgrades are a ""catalyst for the digital transformation of the club"", and they are not the only club keeping an eye on the digital and technological revolution. With the global reach of the world's top clubs continuing to grow every season, increasing profile beyond the physical footprint of fans attending the stadiums will be high on the agenda as virtual and augmented reality is explored. Speaking to Sky Sports, finance expert Kieran Maguire said: ""Looking forwards, there is talk about the rise of the metaverse - the ability to use augmented and virtual reality to bring a matchday experience to people's own homes. ""Manchester United claim to have 1.1bn followers around the world. So, instead of Manchester United being limited to 75,000 people being able to attend Old Trafford, why can't we have some form of match taking place at Old Trafford physically and then have it also simultaneously being broadcast in some 3D format to New York, Lagos, Melbourne and Beijing, and you've got 40 or 50,000 fans attending there. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""All of a sudden, those people are willing to pay the equivalent of 30 or 40 bucks to be in a stadium or 10 bucks to to have that matchday experience at home."" We saw a small glimpse of what the future might hold during the Covid-19 pandemic when fans were locked out of stadiums for a period of time, forcing them to watch games at home, linking up with friends and family on Zoom. So, how does this evolve and what does it mean for stadium design? Populous managing director Lee said: ""The live remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design. ""None of us could possibly predict where digital is going in any sphere, let alone sport, so our job is really to provide an immensely robust backbone that we can accommodate any kinds of potential future digital uses. ""But I think AR, VR and hybrid realities are absolutely going to play a part in our future experience, whether it is in stadium or the remote audience."" ""Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones famously said one per cent of Cowboys fans are going to visit the AT&T stadium, so it's how to deal with the other 99 per cent who won't ever visit that stadium but you know are watching that game at the same time in bars and restaurants all around the world. ""It's about how you connect those people and that's the exciting bit,"" he added. ""We had glimpses of this during the pandemic - the Zoom audiences and the carboard cut-outs in stadiums - but what that showed me was that the live audience is critical. Without the live audience, sport is very different and a very different live experience. But equally, you know that there are 10,000 to 100,000 people and more in little bars around the world, in Sao Paulo, in Sydney and other places, watching that game. ""The question is how we can have those audiences interacting in the same space, digitally. ""Fans, atmosphere and experience, will always play a huge part in stadium design going forward, but digital is probably going to be the biggest change we see."" So, could we be heading to virtual stadiums with family, friends and strangers for matchday experiences in the coming years?

56,West Brom 1-0 Birmingham City: Andreas Weimann scores as Baggies seal late win,https://www.skysports.com/football/w-brom-vs-birmham/report/485061,Author not found,Publish time not found,"West Brom boss Carlos Corberan celebrated the birth of his son with a 1-0 derby victory over Birmingham. Wife Claudia welcomed baby Dario on Friday night before Andreas Weimann snatched a late winner to cap a perfect weekend. The Bristol City loanee netted his first Baggies goal, having joined last month, as Albion consolidated their play-off place. They remain fifth in the Sky Bet Championship while Birmingham - who hit the post through Kevin Long - sit 18th, five points above the drop zone. After the crowd trouble which marred last week's FA Cup Black Country derby defeat to Wolves, Albion needed a quieter afternoon. And if Corberan's new arrival needed a nap he could have just watched the first half at The Hawthorns. There was little zip to the derby, although it is one which is never seen as a grudge match, with Birmingham's neon pink shirts the only bright spot. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports Albion did at least engineer the first serious chance mid-way through the half, although Jed Wallace shot straight at Neil Etheridge. There was commitment, even if the quality was missing, as the Baggies enjoyed most of the possession without being able to hurt their visitors. Ivan Sunjic's 30-yard effort almost slipped through Alex Palmer's fingers to add a glimmer of excitement for Birmingham but it was brief. Blues debutant Alex Pritchard was replaced by Jordan James at half-time but it was the Baggies who upped the derby tempo. Alex Mowatt, though, wasted their best chance after 53 minutes when he headed wide from six yards before Brandon Thomas-Asante volleyed a corner over. Birmingham had barely threatened but almost snatched the lead with 20 minutes left. Andre Dozzell's corner was flicked on by Long, with the ball arching across goal, hitting the inside of the post and bouncing into Palmer's arms. It was a huge let off for the Baggies and they cashed in with five minutes left when Weimann grabbed the winner. Darnell Furlong was given too much time on the right and his cross was turned into the top corner by substitute Weimann. Birmingham midfielder Juninho Bacuna has said he was the victim of alleged racist abuse from a spectator at The Hawthorns. Bacuna was seen in conversation with the officials and senior stewards, pointing to somebody in the home end. Blues boss Tony Mowbray reported afterwards that Bacuna had reported racist abuse. ""I think he was abused, really, racially abused. It's in the hands of the authorities now. He's a bit upset in the dressing room, a bit disappointed. ""These sort of things have to be stamped out."" In a statement, West Midlands Police said: ""We're investigating after a Birmingham City player was racially abused during the game at The Hawthorns today. We'll be looking at CCTV and working with both clubs to identify who was responsible, and offer support to the player. We do not tolerate racist abuse in any form either in football or society in general, and we will seek to prosecute anyone who commits hate crime."" West Brom have also released a statement: ""West Bromwich Albion can confirm Birmingham City player Juninho Bacuna reported an incident of racism to referee David Webb during the second half of today's game. ""Albion will offer its full support to West Midlands Police in their criminal investigation of this matter. The club will also remain in contact with Birmingham City to ensure Juninho Bacuna receives the support he requires at this time. ""The club takes a strong stance against all forms of discrimination and will do all it can to ensure anyone found guilty of racism faces the toughest available legal punishment, in addition to a lifetime ban from The Hawthorns. ""Albion will continue to work with the Football Association, the EFL and all relevant authorities to rid the game of racism."" Sky Sports News have contacted Norwich for a response. West Brom's Carlos Corberan: ""I cannot speculate what happened there but it is something I know - if there is an incident our club will always analyse. ""Because if there is any antagonistic behaviour, I know my club and my players are always against this type of situations. ""I am in a club that is very proactive to create more fair situations for anyone. ""If there was something connecting with racism, I know my players always take the knee and we are one of the clubs that has been making more things in favour to avoid any type of antagonising situations. ""I know the club will take a serious investigation if something has been damaging to people."" Birmingham's Tony Mowbray: ""You have to have a deterrent for the guy who's had a few drinks, he comes to the match and there's an opportunity in his mind to shout some racial abuse. He has to think: 'Hang on a minute'. ""You make decisions and there has to be a consequence, he shouts this thing and he knows he might never watch football again in this stadium. ""The consequences have to be severe. You can't just say 'sorry mate.' What drives someone to say those things? ""Bacca told me what he said, I don't think it's pertinent to share those things but it's not very nice. ""That individual should feel the consequences of his actions. It's right he brings it to the attention of the officials. ""Whose job is it to make the right decisions and what are the consequences? They have to be really harsh so people think twice about racially abusing people.""  Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."
57,Harrogate's Simon Weaver: English football's longest-serving manager on tactical and technical shifts in game,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13069705/harrogates-simon-weaver-english-footballs-longest-serving-manager-on-tactical-and-technical-shifts-in-game,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Simon Weaver and Harrogate Town… two things that have been synonymous with one another for more than 14 years. The former Sheffield Wednesday and Lincoln City defender took charge of The Sulphurites in the summer of 2009 and has guided the club from the Football Conference North to League Two. ""I might be the longest-serving EFL manager, but I'm not the oldest. Would you believe it?"" Weaver, still just 46, tells Sky Sports with a smile. ""Hopefully I've got many years still ahead in the role, because I'm loving it more now than ever!"" Picking up the Sky Bet Manager of the Month award for League Two following a terrific January which saw them pick up 10 points from four games, Weaver revealed his delight at their tremendous start to 2024. ""It's been a joy to watch recently, from our perspective"", he says. ""We've had some gritty away results, away wins, in particular that have laid the foundations for that confidence to enable us to grow."" One key player who enjoyed a fruitful January was winger Abraham Odoh, who picked up two goals and two assists in those four games. Get Sky Sports League Two free highlights ""His season is continuing to get better,"" says Weaver. ""His effort levels are relentless. A fair few wingers can sometimes be whimsical but this guy isn't. He's a gritty winger."" ""He provides so much energy out of possession, but on the ball he's had magical moments. We're delighted with his progress."" With several key players departing the club recently, including defender Kayne Ramsey and forward Luke Armstrong, Weaver took his opportunity in January to dip into the market, bringing in some new recruits to try and continue the club's upwards trajectory. ""Ramsey and Armstrong were integral figures for that time when they were in the team,"" admits Weaver. ""It's no good if we let people go and have no one to come in as a good replacement. The new signings like Tom Bloxam and Derrick Abu have come and already looked good in training."" Harrogate was where Weaver began his managerial career in 2009, and he is still there more than 5,000 days later. It is quite the staggering tenure, particularly in the context of the modern game. It is the transparency between himself and the club that has seen Weaver stay committed and driven for such a long period. ""I've been encouraged by the progression year on year by the club,"" he says. ""It's important that things are aligned on and off the pitch. ""I don't think we've hit a ceiling yet."" With the rapid and forever-changing landscape of football, Weaver has seen it all in his time at the club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think the game's evolved on the pitch tactically,"" he says. ""The way this generation are more developed technically has filtered down from the Premier League. The category one academies in particular have produced players that are technically more advanced than 10 or 15 years ago. ""This has developed and evolved the tactics throughout the leagues. In League Two, formations used to be 3-5-2, or 4-4-2 systems. Now, every manager has come up with different ways of playing and different tactics."" While players have physically and technically developed, Weaver also notes the value he has seen in the advancement of the mental side of the game. ""Psychology plays a huge factor in players' performance levels, at all levels,"" he says. ""There's a difference between going into a game, embracing the moment and actually looking at things from an opportunistic point of view, as opposed to just playing for survival. ""You can recognise players that really don't want the ball and those that do. When everybody's singing from the same hymn sheet, then suddenly you can be a lot more creative as a team and build attacks. Then there's a sort of state of happiness throughout the team."" After nearly 15 years in charge, it seems Weaver continues to be as fresh and enthusiastic as ever. Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."
58,Man Utd 3-0 West Ham: Rasmus Hojlund's goal and two from Alejandro Garnacho move Erik ten Hag’s team sixth,https://www.skysports.com/football/man-utd-vs-west-ham/report/482818,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"Two goals from Alejandro Garnacho helped Manchester United to a 3-0 win over West Ham at Old Trafford and move them up to sixth in the Premier League table. Rasmus Hojlund's fierce shot gave Erik ten Hag's team the lead in the first half, on the occasion of the striker's 21st birthday, before two second-half strikes by Garnacho took the game away from West Ham. Kalvin Phillips made another error for the third goal. West Ham had 20 shots and might have equalised just before Garnacho's first had Emerson Palmieri capitalised on an error by Harry Maguire on the England defender's return to the team. But David Moyes' men were not clinical and their opponents were. The result sees Manchester United leapfrog West Ham into sixth spot and build on the momentum of their late winner at Wolves on Thursday evening. It is five unbeaten in all competitions now. Momentum might just be building at Old Trafford. Man Utd: Onana (6), Dalot (7), Maguire (5), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (6), Garnacho (8), Hojlund (7), Rashford (6).



Subs: McTominay (6), Varane (6), Antony (n/a), Lindelof (n/a).



West Ham: Areola (6), Coufal (6), Johnson (7), Zouma (6), Aguerd (6), Emerson (5), Soucek (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Alvarez (6), Kudus (7), Bowen (6).



Subs: Fabianski (6), Phillips (5), Cornet (6).



Player of the match: Alejandro Garnacho. On the weekend that Old Trafford paid tribute to those who lost their lives in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6 1958, Manchester United were looking to build on their midweek win over Wolves but Moyes' West Ham side made for testing opponents. Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left. In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner. Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd. It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured. But Phillips, on as a substitute after costing his team a goal against Bournemouth in midweek, was then caught out again. Scott McTominay nicked the ball off him in midfield and laid the ball wide for Garnacho to finish expertly with Fabianski flat-footed. Manchester United have had false dawns before and this was far from a totally dominant display. But, with key players back from injury, two wins in four days have begun to change the complexion of their Premier League season. Upwardly mobile once more? Ten Hag revealed afterwards the knee injury to Martinez is ""a personal disaster"" for the player. ""I can't say but it doesn't look good,"" said the United boss when speaking in the press conference. ""There is a bad concern. We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis. ""We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot."" West Ham boss Moyes also said Martinez made ""a huge difference"" for Manchester United. ""He brings much greater calmness on the ball in their build-up play. I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable."" Moyes even highlighted Martinez's role in a key moment in the game when Emerson was running through on the angle after dispossessing Maguire. The Argentina international was able to force Emerson wide. ""I think he was a bit spooked by Martinez.""

59,"Chris Martin interview: Bristol Rovers striker on his time at the club so far, prolific form and favourite loan move",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13069159/chris-martin-interview-bristol-rovers-striker-on-his-time-at-the-club-so-far-prolific-form-and-favourite-loan-move,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Even at the age of 35, Chris Martin shows no sign of slowing down. He has started 2024 in perhaps the best form of his career, becoming a pivotal part of the Bristol Rovers forward line. ""I believe I'm still more than able to contribute an awful lot at this level so I don't really think about my age too much,"" the forward tells Sky Sports after winning the Sky Bet League One Player of the Month award for January - scoring five goals in four matches, including a sublime glancing header away at Barnsley and a cheeky finish against Blackpool. ""When you're in good form you fancy yourself to find the back of the net when the chances come and hopefully I can continue to do that."" Martin opened his account for Rovers in some style against Stevenage back in October as he produced a 'memorable' spectacular 35-yard lob that left the Lamex stunned, but he is unsure whether it is the best goal he has scored in his career. ""I did like that goal but I've also scored a lot of other goals that I like as well that were different types of goals,"" he says. ""The header I scored away at Barnsley was probably the best header I have scored and the backheel against Northampton as well."" League One: Free match highlights League One table Martin's long EFL career started back at Norwich in 2006, and looking back he admits it was a testing period for him. The striker was forced to go out on loan to several different clubs to seek opportunities, get minutes and develop as a striker. ""If you look at my career I've always tried to go out on loan if I have not been playing somewhere,"" Martin says. ""Part of going out on loan for me was trying to show people I was good enough to play at your club or prove I'm better than people thought I was at the time."" Martin looks back at the first loan move of his career to Luton Town in 2008/09 as a special time, despite the circumstances surrounding the club as they began the season with minus 30 points following their exit from administration. ""Working under Mick Harford at Luton who is a great guy and really good manager helped me settle really easily which doesn't always happen with loan moves,"" he says. ""We won the Johnstone Paint Trophy during my time there which was a really special achievement, especially to do it with the fans at that time who had been wronged to a certain extent."" Derby County is where he spent the longest spell of his career. He thrived in front of goal there, ending his first two seasons as top goalscorer and scoring 65 goals in 186 appearances, while also reaching the Championship play-off final in 2014. ""Looking back it was the time there and individual success I had which forged my reputation as player,"" he says. ""The way I played and the goals I scored, looking back, gives me a feeling of real fondness for my years at that club."" Martin initially only joined Bristol Rovers on a short-term deal until January. But he has made a real impact already, scoring 11 goals in 21 league matches, and his record of scoring a goal every 130 minutes is the best in League One. No wonder he has one eye on rivalling Barnsley's Devante Cole for the golden boot come the end of the season.

60,Cole Palmer thriving for Chelsea ahead of Man City return following reunion with talent-spotter Joe Shields,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13072250/cole-palmer-thriving-for-chelsea-ahead-of-man-city-return-following-reunion-with-talent-spotter-joe-shields,Nick Wright,Publish time not found,"Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez scored the goals that clinched Chelsea's 3-1 win over Crystal Palace on Monday. But it was no surprise to see Cole Palmer have a hand in both. After laying the ball back for Gallagher to score Chelsea's second, the 21-year-old played the through-ball for Fernandez to add the third. With six assists to add to his 10 goals, he has been directly involved in nearly 40 per cent of Chelsea's total this season. Where would they be without him? It hardly bears thinking about given they sit 10th as it is. But it could easily have been their reality. Palmer was an eleventh-hour signing and might never have arrived at all if not for the influence of Joe Shields. Chelsea's co-director of recruitment and talent, formerly of Manchester City and Southampton, is said to have played a significant role in his arrival from the Etihad Stadium, completed for a fee of £42.5m on the final day of the summer transfer window. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The club's recruitment under Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali has of course thrown up more questions than answers. But there can be no doubting the wisdom of signing Palmer. Not that it necessarily felt that way at the time. Palmer had only started three Premier League games under Pep Guardiola. But Shields was convinced of his potential having watched him closely across a nine-year spell at City during which he rose to the role of head of academy recruitment. Chelsea fixtures Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream the Premier League on NOW Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His work there, starting out as their academy scouting manager for the south of the UK, earned him a stellar reputation, with Jadon Sancho among the many players he identified and helped to recruit before moving to Southampton and, subsequently, Chelsea. His belief in Palmer has been emphatically vindicated and the hope for Chelsea is that Romeo Lavia, another former City academy player who Shields previously took to Southampton, will prove similarly successful once he recovers from injury. That would be another boon for Shields, who is only 36 but whose experience in the industry spans two decades and whose journey to the top began at grassroots level in Croydon, south London, in the form of community coaching sessions in Thornton Heath. ""Joe had basically decided coaching wasn't for him,"" says Harry Hudson, who worked at the same sessions and now runs the Kinetic Academy. ""So, while I was focusing on coaching, Joe was trying to go his own way, bringing players to the sessions, finding gems. ""It was difficult because, 20 years ago, there weren't as many roles in football as there are now. There was coaching, but there were no analysts. Agents weren't as big a thing. Scouting was this back-of-a-fag-packet role nobody really understood."" Shields was also coming at it as a teenager with no prior professional experience in the industry. ""That made it even harder for him,"" adds Hudson. ""But Joe just had this incredible passion. He was so interested in being out and active in the community finding players. He got an absolute buzz from it. You could see that when he found someone. ""And then he had his ridiculous ability to spot talent."" It soon got him noticed. ""When you're finding players, it quickly puts you on the map,"" says Hudson. Part-time scouting roles at Crystal Palace and Fulham followed. Even after going full-time at Palace, Shields continued flagging players to Hudson. One of them was striker Josh Maja, who has gone on to play for Sunderland, Fulham, Bordeaux and West Brom while also representing Nigeria internationally, and who now serves as one of many examples of Shields' ability to forecast potential. ""Josh had just come out of Fulham's academy aged 13,"" says Hudson. ""Joe brought him into a session with us at Kinetic and told me, 'This player is going to play in the Premier League one day'. ""I did the session and I wasn't convinced. I said, 'Joe, I don't see it, he doesn't move well'. Joe just said, 'Trust me, he's got it. Work with him, develop him and he will be there'. ""He was 100 per cent right but I didn't see it at the time. I didn't see that long-term potential in Josh like Joe did. And I like to think of myself as someone who can see talent."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Shields was even more confident on Sancho. He is sometimes credited for ""unearthing"" the winger, which is not strictly true. But he was certainly aware of his potential from early on. ""When Watford picked up Sancho, Joe said he would be in the England squad in six years,"" says Hudson. ""I remember saying to him, 'Are you joking? He's a kid'. In the end he got there even quicker."" Shields' talent-spotting ability and exhaustive knowledge of the younger market have been key to his rise in the industry. ""He knows all the good young players and all the kids who have potential,"" former Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl told Sky Sports after Shields' appointment as head of senior recruitment at St Mary's in 2022. But he is similarly skilled at building relationships. ""Having the foresight to think a player can be great is one thing but convincing a coaching team at a club to actually sign that player is probably the hardest part of any job in recruitment,"" says Hudson. ""Especially when we are talking about young players from areas such as south London. A coach might have worked with their group for six months. They know Jimmy will do what he is coached to do. ""So, if a player comes in who is a bit of a wildcard, who does things off the cuff, it is only natural for the coach to have a bias towards the player they already know and trust. ""It is often about having those relationships where you can get coaches and staff members to see the vision you do. That is something Joe has always had quite a unique ability for."" That ability is now being applied at the highest level. But, back in south London, Shields is still known for his eagerness to help open doors for young players, coaches and others who might be looking to break into the world of recruitment. ""Even when Joe was working at City, there were players that he referred to us at Kinetic,"" says Hudson. ""At other times, I would go to him with a player who I thought could get a deal, not at City but somewhere, and he would always be eager to help. ""If he could see the player's potential, whether it was for Man City or Ipswich Town, he would always try to help the kid and his family out. That's something that is pretty unusual in football."" Shields retains family ties in the area. ""He came down to our 10-year anniversary match at Kinetic a few years ago, at Selhurst Park, to see us all and talk to some of the players who have been through our programme,"" says Hudson. ""He spoke about players who have been released from professional academies and might want to go into scouting and recruitment, that he would always be there to help them in any way he could. ""He is in a different stratosphere now. He has come a long way from the Croydon days. But I do genuinely believe that is true... It just might take him a few more days to get back to you than it did."" Such are the demands of his role at Chelsea. Saturday's return to Manchester City shines a light on the Cole Palmer success story. But, for Shields, the search is now on to deliver more.

63,Man City 2-0 Everton: Erling Haaland's late double breaks Toffees' resistance and sends champions top,https://www.skysports.com/football/man-city-vs-everton/report/482826,Nick Wright,Publish time not found,"Erling Haaland's late double sent Manchester City temporarily top of the Premier League as they beat Everton 2-0 to extend their winning run to 10 games in all competitions. The striker rifled home the opening goal with City's first shot on target following a corner in the 71st minute before adding a breakaway second from substitute Kevin De Bruyne's pass. Everton had defended doggedly before that, despite Sean Dyche's absence from the dugout as he served a touchline ban, but City's quality told as top scorer Haaland found the net in the Premier League for the first time since November, taking his tally to 16. The victory briefly put Pep Guardiola's side a point ahead of Liverpool prior to their victory over Burnley, and ensures Everton, deducted 10 points earlier this season, remain in trouble in 18th place and without a win in seven Premier League games. Man City: Ederson (7), Stones (7), Akanji (6), Dias (7), Ake (7), Rodri (7), Nunes (6), Foden (7), Alvarez (6), Doku (7), Haaland (9).


Subs used: De Bruyne (7), Walker (7), Bernardo Silva (7), Grealish (6).


Everton: Pickford (6), Godfrey (7), Tarkowski (7), Branthwaite (6), Mykolenko (6), Young (6), Garner (7), Gueye (7), McNeil (6), Harrison (6), Calvert-Lewin (6).

Player of the match: Erling Haaland Everton claimed a point in this fixture last season, holding the champions to a 1-1 draw, and they picked up where they left off at the Etihad Stadium with an obstinate first-half performance. City, missing the thrust and quality of the benched De Bruyne, struggled to create any chances of note, with their only meaningful openings coming on the rare occasions Jeremy Doku was able to escape Ben Godfrey and Ashley Young's attentions on the left. Haaland headed over from one Doku cross but was otherwise a peripheral figure, with City's approach play lacking speed and incisiveness against their well-organised opponents. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Everton sought to break forward when possible, causing occasional problems for the hosts, with Jack Harrison firing one half-chance over at the far post. For the most part, though, they were focused on protecting their own goal. There was a string of Everton blocks in the first period, including one by James Tarkowski from a close-range Manuel Akanji effort which had City optimistically appealing for handball. And the visitors continued to frustrate City after the break, with Guardiola's side mostly reduced to speculative long-range efforts as Julian Alvarez and Rodri fired over the bar. Guardiola leant into City's formidable strength in depth, however, as the rested De Bruyne and Kyle Walker came on for Matheus Nunes and Akanji, and finally the breakthrough arrived. It resulted from a set-piece as City's initial header was blocked and Everton failed to clear their lines, allowing Haaland to smash a first-time shot into the net past Jordan Pickford. Everton tried to muster a response but substitute Beto wasted their best openings by twice drifting offside and their efforts to find a leveller left more space for City, which they exploited on the break as De Bruyne's early pass released Haaland for the second. The big Norwegian outmuscled Jarrad Branthwaite to go one-on-one with Pickford before stroking a calm finish into the far corner to wrap up the win and move two goals clear of Mohamed Salah at the top of the Premier League scoring charts. City had a chance to add to their lead in the closing stages as De Bruyne's attempted lob of a stranded Pickford landed on the roof of the net. But the win was already assured, adding to City's momentum and extending Everton's winless run. Man City boss Pep Guardiola said: ""I love to win this type of game. The difficulty is there. We knew it, we talked about it. ""Always Everton here at home is really complicated. We've lost a lot of points over many years. What pleased me the most is something the people cannot see - the body shape, the positivity, the body language. ""In the first half, we were complaining. I know a 12.30 [kick-off] is more difficult but our body language was not good. The chemistry between the players, when they lose a ball or something is not going well, has to be better. ""But in the second half, it was much better. In general, it was well deserved. I like to win this type of game - suffering and knowing how difficult everything is - because we learn the lessons for what's coming."" On Haaland and De Bruyne's returns to fitness, he added: ""With Erling and Kevin we are stronger, that's obvious, but when a team loses the consistency, we have to be worried with the way they train, behave and run. ""But the good attitude was always there. When that happens the team is alive. I was never concerned. Since day one I didn't have the feeling. There are ups and downs, it's normal, but I still liked what I saw."" Everton boss Sean Dyche to TNT Sports: ""We did well at containing them, with that side of the game, but not as well in turnovers and transitions, which was frustrating because you've got to play both parts of the game. ""It was pleasing that their goal was their first shot on target, from the defensive perspective, but the transitions are massive. We gave the ball away so many times in good positions. ""We won the ball in good areas and then, getting to the final third, didn't have the same kind of conviction. ""That's why they are a top side, of course. They do both sides of the game very well, and if they're not doing it very well, they bring five players on who can. ""The second goal is such a cheap goal and a cheap moment to give it away."" On Everton's seven-game winless run, he added: ""I don't think my noise changed when we had four wins on the trot. I think I stayed [even]. It's no different to me. It's a season's work, even more so this season with all the noise about the 10 points - and we'll see if that changes. But the commitment is very good.""

64,Huddersfield Town 4-0 Sheffield Wednesday: Terriers storm to victory in second half,https://www.skysports.com/football/huddsfld-vs-sheff-wed/report/485052,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Managerless Huddersfield boosted their Championship survival hopes by thrashing fellow strugglers Sheffield Wednesday 4-0 at the John Smith's Stadium. All four goals came in the final quarter of the contest as the Terriers recorded their biggest victory of the season. Josh Koroma scored a 10-minute brace with Matty Pearson and Sorba Thomas adding one apiece to earn Town their first win since Boxing Day. It was their first match under interim boss Jon Worthington following the sacking of Darren Moore on Monday. After a scrappy start, Wednesday went close to getting their noses in front in the ninth minute. Djeidi Gassama put Huddersfield's defence on the back foot before teeing up Ike Ugbo, whose shot was deflected over by Tom Lees. From the resulting corner, Michael Ihiekwe saw his looping header cleared off the line by Rhys Healey as the visitors continue to press for the opener. Huddersfield offered precious little in an attacking sense, with Koroma shooting wide when well placed after good work from Bojan Radulovic. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports They were then forced into a tactical reshuffle after Healey was forced off with a groin injury. Ben Wiles was introduced to the fray as the hosts looked to get a grip of the midfield battle. It was a full-blooded contest packed full of industry but low on quality. The tackles continued to fly in and Kristian Pedersen - who was making his Wednesday debut after arriving on loan from Swansea on deadline day - was cautioned after bundling over Alex Matos. James Beadle was finally forced into action in the Wednesday goal after 34 minutes, expertly charging down Thomas' effort following an excellent pass from Wiles. Huddersfield, who are on the hunt for their third permanent boss of the season following Moore's dismissal last Monday, finished the half strongly. Jonathan Hogg slipped Thomas in down the right but Radulovic was unable to turn in the winger's dangerous centre after Beadle was caught out of position. The hosts lost another forward through injury after the break, with Brahima Diarra taking over from Radulovic. But Worthington's side broke the deadlock midway through the half. Pearson rose highest at the back post to head in Thomas' corner. It was the defender's second goal of the campaign. Things got even better for Huddersfield in the 70th minute as Koroma doubled their advantage. He raced onto Wiles' inviting through ball before coolly firing the ball past Beadle. As Wednesday committed more bodies forward, they left themselves open at the back and Huddersfield ruthlessly exposed them by bagging a third through Thomas after he shrugged off the attentions of Pederson. Koroma added a fourth in the 80th minute to compound Wednesday's woes. No team in the Championship has lost more away games than Wednesday this term (12) and the defeat leaves the visitors second-bottom, eight points from safety. Huddersfield's caretaker manager Jon Worthington: ""It was a privilege for me to take the game. ""I have been here since I was nine years old; I'm normally sat with my kids in the stand supporting. ""To be asked to step in and do that was a great honour and I'm in dreamland when it's 4-0. ""I will sit back tonight and no one can take that away from me. It is a special moment for me and my family, who are here every single week. ""We knew we had to win the game and that was the message throughout. Nothing else. ""I think you have to go into every home game with that mentality regardless of the opposition. ""I respect Sheffield Wednesday and the job that (manager) Danny (Rohl) has done there but I was really keen to make the game about us and what we can do. ""I wanted us to be on the front foot and impact it today. ""It was so important to get the result. It lifts everybody. ""The players and the staff are buzzing in the dressing room as well as the fans, who will go home extremely happy this evening."" Sheffield Wednesday's Danny Rohl: ""Until the first goal, it was a typical fight from both teams. Both teams had their moments. We didn't play how I wanted us to play on the ground. ""It was an open game and we had our moments. We conceded from a corner and after this we lost a little bit of our head. We wanted to come back immediately and we were open. ""The goals we conceded were too easy. We have to play 100 per cent for 90-plus minutes and if we don't do this, it's hard to take something. ""We put in a great performance against Watford on Wednesday and today we lost 4-0 and it is a knock for everybody. ""Everybody is disappointed. I will lift them on Monday. ""There are still 16 games to go. It's a challenge but it's what we have to do."" ""I have learned a lot about my team in the last few months and how big the morale is. Today is a setback in our fight. ""I always spoke about our process but it is about taking results now. I will go forward and lead this group and at the end we will see if it is enough. Today was not good enough. ""As long as I'm the manager here, we will fight in every game to take something. We have to come back stronger and try again.""

65,Liverpool: Jamie Carragher explains why Xabi Alonso is standout candidate to replace Jurgen Klopp,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/13070358/liverpool-jamie-carragher-explains-why-xabi-alonso-is-standout-candidate-to-replace-jurgen-klopp,Jamie Carragher,Publish time not found,"Jamie Carragher provided a tactical breakdown of how Xabi Alonso masterminded a resounding 3-0 victory over Bayern Munich to cement Bayer Leverkusen's place at the Bundesliga summit - and rubberstamp his own credentials as a future Liverpool manager... There's a great chance that Xabi Alonso is going to be the next Liverpool manager. He seems the standout favourite, and when you think of the great managers and where they start, a lot of them do something pretty remarkable at a slightly lower level perhaps. When you think of what Jose [Mourinho] did at Porto, winning the Champions League and Jurgen Klopp winning two Bundesliga titles with Borussia Dortmund. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When you look at Alonso and what it looks like he's about to achieve with Bayer Leverkusen, and the result they had at the weekend, it is insightful to see his way of playing, how he goes about it and how it might be different to what we're seeing now with Klopp at Liverpool. At the weekend, it wasn't a normal Bayer Leverkusen performance in that they didn't dominate possession. They only had 39 per cent of the ball but they were fantastic defensively. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  What I liked about their set-up was how compact they are. We're talking 15 yards from back to front. The great teams are defensively compact. We're normally looking at 25 to 30 yards. There's time on the ball but look at how compact they are. Liverpool fixtures Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! You also have to look at their set-up. Bayer Leverkusen under Alonso without the ball this season have been a back five. He likes two sitting midfielders, and he likes a front three with Florian Wirtz as the false No 9 as he had one striker out injured who is at the Africa Cup of Nations and Patrik Schick who was on the bench. The reason they're so good defensively and are the best in the Bundesliga by a long way is because of this compactness. The thing that really stands out for me is even though we talk about them as a back five defensively, is how quickly they morph into a back four when in possession. Almost every team now plays and sets up differently with and without the ball. The back five play a couple of passes and it becomes a back four. A big reason for this is that they've got a wing-back in [Alex] Grimaldo who continually from his position steps into midfield. We see that in the Premier League with [Oleksandr] Zinchenko and [Trent] Alexander-Arnold where full-backs go into midfield, but they play the deeper role. They come inside like a sitting midfield player. But he's almost like an attacking midfielder. When Wirtz bursts through the middle, you can see his options which include the wing-back. You can see Grimaldo on one side and both Amine Adli and Nathan Tella on the other making runs. In this example, Adli should have put them 1-0 in front, but it summed the game up. Bayern's reaction to the subsequent throw-in summed them up. It was awful. It didn't just happen with the throw-in but it also happens with the man at the back post. Bayer restricted Bayern Munich to 0.56 xG - the lowest they've had in the Bundesliga this season. This is another example of just how compact they are from back to front. With the ball on one side of the pitch, all 11 players were not letting Bayern Munich out. They actually do get out, but they've got to go back. They very rarely penetrated Leverkusen right throughout the game. On several occasions, Eric Dier was forced to play long towards the wide areas but a big part of this Xabi Alonso team are short passes that entice people in. With two or three, you see the Bayern Munich team get dragged across. It's a big part of where the game is going in modern football. So many teams now make short passes to entice people on to see if they can break through the lines or if they can switch play. On this occasion, [Piero] Hincapie is the left-sided centre-back who becomes the attacking left-back. The back five becomes a back four with Grimaldo having moved forward. Tella is found at the back post and on the rebound, Wirtz almost makes it 2-0. I want to highlight again the role of Wirtz. He's a young man who is starting to get into that Germany squad. He's the flair player and the big name of this team. His role in this game was to play behind the two No 6s for Bayern as Leverkusen normally play with a striker. Eric Dier has gone in tight on him. Again, it is about enticing players in. It leads to Bayer having a two-v-two situation. Min-jae Kim and Dayot Upamecano are left exposed. The ball is worked wide to Grimaldo, who has his left-sided centre-back [Hincapie] now bombing on his outside. Because he has that option to his left, Grimaldo can make the run inside. It's completely different to what we see from other full-backs or wing-backs when they go into midfield, and he finishes it off with a great finish. The third goal is also from a wing-back as [Jeremie] Frimpong comes on but that was from a corner-kick where Manuel Neuer had gone up. But looking at Grimaldo's stats, you think of Trent Alexander-Arnold. When you look at his stats, he's had 10 goals from wing-back and 11 assists. When you talk about spending lots of money to get the best players in, Grimaldo has come on a free transfer in the summer. That's pretty special. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Bayer Leverkusen to be top of anything is pretty special. When you think of the squad they've got and the money that's being spent. When you ask if this is the perfect fit for Liverpool, what stands out for me are the number of passes and the amount that are short. So far, 646 of their 683 have been short. It comes to 95 per cent which is probably not what Liverpool are right now under Klopp. It's more reminiscent of what we see from a Pep Guardiola team. It's interesting when we put that on a scatter graph, and you can see Bayer Leverkusen alongside Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain [among Europe's top five leagues]. You can see Liverpool are further behind. We know from watching them that they are a more direct team and use counter-attacks more. From the company Leverkusen are keeping, we can say that Alonso's own influence is more like Pep Guardiola, which makes sense as he's been his manager. But if Xabi Alonso was to become the Liverpool manager, which I think he will, I feel they are quite fortunate given that Jurgen Klopp has chosen this moment to move on. The timing for Alonso to step in is pretty perfect given the job he's doing. Would I expect Alonso's Liverpool to be higher up this scatter graph? Maybe. But I would expect somewhere in the middle - like where Bayern Munich are on the graph - as he has to have his own philosophy and his own imprint. This team is so used to playing a certain way under Jurgen Klopp, there's the Anfield factor with the crowd, the energy. Xabi Alonso knows that so I would expect to see a merging of the two styles if he were to get the job. There is no doubt that right now he's looking like the brightest young thing as a manager. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Germany's Felix Fischer: ""He does such a tremendous job. He is not only a genius tactician and in terms of how he prepares his team, but he is a gentleman. Everything he does, he does right. ""After the game, the fans wanted to celebrate with him but he spoke with his assistants and coaches to make sure they also joined him in the celebrations. He didn't want to celebrate it alone which shows the respect he has for his entire team, for the fans and for the entire club. ""I imagine he will be the Liverpool coach one day but Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes said on Sunday that he is really sure that Alonso will still be the coach next season. ""All the top teams do have an eye on him. The boss of Bayern Munich will have an eye on him for some day, as well as Real Madrid. It's going to be a race for Alonso. I don't think it'll take place in the summer, but the season after that.""

66,Nigeria 1-2 Ivory Coast: Sebastien Haller seals Africa Cup of Nations final comeback for host nation,https://www.skysports.com/football/nigeria-vs-ivory-coast/report/500698,Ben Grounds,Publish time not found,"Hosts Ivory Coast completed one of Africa Cup of Nations' most memorable comebacks to be crowned champions of Africa for a third time as Nigeria were beaten 2-1 in Abidjan. Nigeria captain and former Watford centre-back William Troost-Ekong headed the Super Eagles in front against the run of play at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium (38). Franck Kessie rose at the far post to meet Simon Adingra's corner to deservedly level matters (61). Ivory Coast looked set for an early exit when they lost their final group game 4-0 to Equatorial Guinea but scraped through to the knockout phase before beating Senegal, Mali and DR Congo. But Sebastien Haller met another Adingra cross to superbly flick home the winner (81) for his most important contribution in an Ivory Coast shirt.

Man of the match: Sebastien Haller. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is not often you qualify from your group as the fourth of four best third-placed sides, sack your coach and end up with your name on the trophy. But this is the Africa Cup of Nations, a competition that is unrivalled when it comes to drama and the improbable made possible. AFCON results and fixtures Get NOW to stream Sky Sports Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Get Sky Sports It was a triumph born from adversity as the Ivorians scraped out of their group following two defeats before finding their form in the knockout rounds with a never-say-die attitude that led them to the title. Ivory Coast looked out on their feet when they were trounced 4-0 by Equatorial Guinea. They needed favours from elsewhere. They had to squeeze past the holders Senegal on penalties. Against Mali, they needed a late equaliser and their semi-final victory over DR Congo was by the narrowest of margins. And yet, in front of a partisan crowd of 60,000, there was a sense of inevitability that this magical journey on home soil would have its fairytale ending. With Haller, the hosts hit their high point. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The home side controlled much of this year's final as Adingra was denied by a fine save from Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali, before the visitors took the lead with their first effort on target on 38 minutes. Troost-Ekong headed into the net when Ademola Lookman's corner was flicked on by Chukwueze and the Nigerian captain won the second ball ahead of Serge Aurier. The hosts had an excellent chance to equalise early in the second half when the ball fell to Max Gradel in the box but his fierce shot was blocked by Calvin Bassey. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Nwabali had to beat away a superb long-range shot from Adingra but from the resulting corner Ivory Coast equalised when Kessie was left unmarked at the back post and headed into the net. It was the home side who pushed for the winner and came close when Haller attempted a spectacular overhead kick, but the ball flashed wide of goal. The tall striker did not have to wait long for his goal though as moments later he steered Adingra's whipped cross into the net to crown a fantastic story. Sky Sports' Ben Grounds: Group A proved a debacle as the hosts buckled under the pressure to finish third. It became a case of having nothing left to lose as Ivory Coast dragged themselves from another setback over the line. Nigeria scored from their first corner and their first shot on target, but they were a distant second. Emerse Fae deserves so much credit in this incredible story for getting his team believing in themselves again. The Ivorians had to come from behind several times in the tournament and did it again when Haller steered Adingra's cross into the net, much to the delight of his rookie coach, who had started the tournament as assistant to sacked Frenchman Jean-Louis Gasset. Haller was diagnosed with testicular cancer in July 2022 but beat the disease and has been a crucial player for the Ivorians, though he missed the start of the tournament with an ankle injury, playing his first game in the last-16 win over defending champions Senegal. His story epitomises the fight in the Ivorian side, who became the first home nation to lift the Cup of Nations since Egypt in 2006. All four of their previous continental finals had finished 0-0, with them winning on penalties in 1992 and 2015, both times against Ghana, and losing the other two. As Haller was embraced by Didier Drogba on the touchline at the final whistle as his country's match-winner, it was hard not to feel moved by his own personal journey that had reached its zenith. Besides their goal, Nigeria did not turn up as star striker Victor Osimhen toiled in the sweltering conditions. A fourth AFCON title slipped through their fingers as the night belonged to the hosts.

They were the better team, they were all over us. ""You could see them just coming after us, and they won the game. The two centre-backs were brilliant today, phenomenal. But Adingra was their key man. ""He was going from the start to the end - kept going, kept going, kept attacking. It paid off with their second goal. The tactics were brilliant, it worked for them and we didn't do much about it."" Former Ghana assistant George Boateng on Sky Sports: ""From start to finish, Ivory Coast were the better team. The significance of the game says it all, the fact they've gone behind and come back. ""The mental toughness, the mental strength to believe in the fact they can come back and win the game. The timing of the substitution to take off Aurier, who was five seconds away from being sent off, was perfect from the coach. ""For me, there are two outstanding players for Ivory Coast in this game - the two centre-backs. Ndicka and Kossounou were outstanding. ""If I'm a holding midfielder with those two behind me, who can play and defend with all their lives, I thought it was tremendous. ""Adingra caused all sorts of problems for Aina, and we were talking about earlier that he looked tired. I think that was just because he was run ragged.""

67,Arsenal stunned by West Ham turnaround as Man Utd beat Brighton - Women's Super League round-up,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/36996/13062634/arsenal-stunned-by-west-ham-turnaround-as-man-utd-beat-brighton-womens-super-league-round-up,Author not found,Publish time not found,"West Ham came from behind to dent Arsenal's Women's Super League title hopes with a stunning 2-1 victory. Jonas Eidevall's side had been on course to close the gap on leaders Chelsea at the Chigwell Construction Stadium with captain Leah Williamson making her first start since returning from injury, but after she was substituted at half-time as part of her return to full fitness, the Gunners conceded twice within 15 minutes of the second half and could not recover. Alessia Russo had headed Arsenal into a deserved lead at the end of the first half which also saw Vivianne Miedema strike the West Ham crossbar. However, the game changed in the 50th minute when Stephanie Catley was adjudged to have brought down Riko Ueki just inside the box and Viviane Asseyi kept her cool from the penalty spot, sending goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger the wrong way. Zinsberger was then at fault eight minutes later as West Ham took the lead. Her punch at a free-kick was poor and fell to centre-back Hawa Cissoko, who impressively turned the ball back past the goalkeeper and into the net. Arsenal pushed hard for an equaliser, racking up 23 shots in total, with Russo firing over when well positioned in the box and appeals for a penalty on substitute Cloe Lacasse were waved away as West Ham held on for their first home win in 12 matches.

68,Nottingham Forest 1-1 Bristol City (5-3 on penalties): Matt Turner the hero as Forest set up FA Cup fifth-round tie with Man Utd,https://www.skysports.com/football/n-forest-vs-bristol-c/report/503104,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Matt Turner came good for Nottingham Forest as he was the hero in a penalty shootout win against Bristol City which set up an FA Cup fifth-round tie with Manchester United. Turner has made several high-profile mistakes in recent weeks which saw boss Nuno Espirito Santo sign a new goalkeeper in the January transfer window. But the United States international kept Bristol City at bay throughout 120 minutes and then saved Sam Bell's spot-kick as Forest won the shootout 5-3 after the tie had ended 1-1. Divock Origi's first goal for Forest since his summer move from AC Milan had given them an early lead but the spirited Championship side troubled their Premier League hosts throughout and levelled through Jason Knight. They could have won the tie in both normal and extra-time had it not been for Turner, who pulled off a string of saves throughout the night. Forest's reward is a fifth-round match against Manchester United at the City Ground in three weeks, though they will have to improve immeasurably considering they have laboured past League One Blackpool in the third round and now the second-tier Robins. Forest, who made eight changes from the side that drew at Bournemouth in the league on Sunday, had designs on an easy night when they took an eighth-minute lead. FA Cup fixtures Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports Morgan Gibbs-White forced Max O'Leary into a stunning one-handed save down to his right, but from the resulting corner Origi glanced home to break his Forest duck. However, it quickly became apparent that a long night was in store as the Robins levelled six minutes later. Turner tipped Andy King's shot from distance onto one post, the ball rolled across the line and hit the other post, where Haydon Roberts collected it and teed up Knight to tap into an empty net. Turner then had to get down well to save Anis Mehmeti's effort and did even better to keep out Tommy Conway's low shot as Forest were on the rack. Mehmeti had another effort saved by Turner early in the second half as the Forest goalkeeper was kept busy. Forest sent on Taiwo Awoniyi and Callum Hudson-Odoi to try and wrestle control of the game. And they began to build some pressure in the final 10 minutes. Nuno Tavares saw a drilled effort parried by O'Leary before Hudson-Odoi teed up Neco Williams but he shot just wide as the game went to an additional period. Both sides had chances in extra-time as the impenetrable Turner again denied Mehmeti with a stretching save while Moussa Niakhate sent a free header wide. It was the Championship side who were pushing for a winner in the second period as Nahki Wells was somehow denied on the line after a good move down the left while Matty James whistled a shot over from a corner. But the game was decided from the penalty spot and Turner denied Bell, which allowed Awoniyi to fire home the winning kick.

72,"Liverpool, Arsenal or Man City? Three-way Premier League title race analysed",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13070548/liverpool-arsenal-or-man-city-three-way-premier-league-title-race-analysed,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal are divided by just two points as we approach the business end of the Premier League campaign - but which team is in pole position to take the crown come May? We take a look at each side's prospects, including pundit verdicts from Gary Neville and Paul Merson, and have a deep dive into the stats. Reasons to be confident Their attacking firepower has propelled them to the top of table and could yet keep them there. They have smashed 12 goals in the last four Premier League games without Mo Salah, a testament to their depth, and the Egyptian is now closing in on a return to fitness. There is encouragement at the other end of the pitch too, where Virgil van Dijk has returned to something approaching his best level, Alisson remains the Premier League's undisputed top goalkeeper, and Andrew Robertson is fit again after four months out. Could the announcement of Jurgen Klopp's departure at the end of the season further boost their chances? Certainly, the emotion should enhance the atmosphere at Anfield. City still have to go there, remember, having only won one of their seven Premier League visits under Pep Guardiola - and that was without fans during the 2020/21 campaign. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Reasons to be cautious Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Klopp has worked wonders with Liverpool's midfield, restructuring it almost from scratch after the departures of Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner and Naby Keita last summer. But they still lack a No 6 to rival Rodri or Declan Rice. Another injury to Thiago Alcantara limits their options further in that part of the pitch and, despite Van Dijk's fine form, there remain doubts in defence too, with Joel Matip's absence leaving them reliant on the excellent but sometimes injury-prone Ibrahima Konate. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  They have only conceded 23 goals, the second-fewest after Arsenal, but is the current rate sustainable? The underlying numbers show they give their opponents far better chances than City and Arsenal, with 29.63 expected goals against (xGa) given up so far, compared to City's 22.14 and Arsenal's 18.05. Reasons to be confident How long have you got? After 11 consecutive wins in all competitions and six in the Premier League, it feels like Manchester City are clicking into gear once more, ready to blow the competition away in the second half of the season yet again. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Guardiola's players know exactly what it takes to get over the line as they chase an unprecedented fourth consecutive title triumph. They have recovered from far worse situations than the one they found themselves in earlier this season. Their strength in depth is unrivalled, allowing them to plough on even without players of the calibre of Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. Now that duo are back, and the injury list is clear, there is a growing feeling of inevitability about what happens next. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Reasons to be cautious The fact no other side has won four in a row is the main one. Amid stiff competition from Liverpool and Arsenal, and still juggling three competitions, can they maintain the level required for a fourth consecutive season? There is a reason it has never been done before. The other glimmer of hope for their rivals is that they look more defensively vulnerable than in previous campaigns. Having let in 25 goals in 23 games, they are conceding at their highest rate under Guardiola, even including the 2016/17 campaign, when they finished third. City have developed a habit of conceding from their opponent's first shot on target. Their defence will face a stern test when they face Manchester United, Liverpool, Brighton, Arsenal and Aston Villa in consecutive games starting in March. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Reasons to be confident Arsenal are regarded as the unlikeliest of the three contenders but titles are usually won by the best defence and the Gunners appear to have that this season. Their expected goals against total of only 18.05 is unrivalled, reflecting their ability to suppress chances. Arsenal could not find a level of cutting edge to match their defensive prowess in the early months of the season but that appears to be changing. They have rattled in 16 goals in their last four games. Have the floodgates opened? Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli certainly appear to be reaching top form, while improvement can also be seen in Martin Odegaard, Leandro Trossard and Kai Havertz, with Gabriel Jesus still to come back too. Rice's impact has been immense and the group appear hungrier and mentally stronger than last season. Reasons to be cautious Last season's capitulation hangs over them. Having surrendered such a healthy lead over City, when it felt like they might never get a better chance, they now have a lot to prove in terms of staying power. These players do not have the same level of trophy-winning experience as their rivals. For all Arsenal's recent improvement offensively, there remain serious question marks in the No 9 position too. Jesus gives them many things, but he is not a prolific scorer. Could the lack of that out-and-out striker with a killer touch still cost them? Unlike Liverpool, who escaped with a draw from their own visit, Arsenal also have to go to the Etihad Stadium, a formidable test at a ground where they have a wretched record. Given the race could be decided by fine margins, defeat there could do severe damage.

I do still think Manchester City, at this moment in time, look ominous, but I want Arsenal to do it.

It's helped them that they've not been in front and had no pressure or expectation. They need to sit there, sit there, sit there, and pounce at the end. That's how they'll need to win the league. Last season I never thought they'd win the league, this year they can. They have more control. I'm feeling it for them. ""For Arteta to break Klopp and Guardiola would be huge for the Premier League - we want disruption. ""Manchester City have been incredible, Guardiola is a genius and Klopp is the best manager over the last six years having worked against Guardiola with the resources he had. If Arteta could drive through the middle of them it would be monumental. I can't wait for the next three months. I want them to be controlled. To be determined. And to know there is a long way to go."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We've still got a little bit to go before we get to the serious business of the run-in. That all starts with eight games to go in my opinion. ""Then we get to back to the importance of which team plays first on the weekend. It plays a huge part, in my opinion. Arsenal had to win at West Ham just to stay where they are. It takes its toll. ""We saw it a few years ago now with Spurs when they were chasing Leicester. They kept playing second. Talk to Tiger Woods about match play. He wants to put his ball on the green first to build the pressure on his opponent. ""It makes a huge difference."" Sky Sports' data editor Adam Smith: Merse's point about the importance of going first: Liverpool go first on Saturday and, after City play their rescheduled game with Brentford on Tuesday, Klopp's side kickstart another round of games on Wednesday. However, City could leapfrog Liverpool by a single point if they capitalise on their game in hand against the Bees on Tuesday - assuming both sides win this weekend. Of course, if either or neither win, Arsenal wait in the wings. Arsenal and City are now level on goal difference after the Gunners' impressive 6-0 win at West Ham, while Liverpool lead the pair by just a single goal. In terms of form, the charts below highlight how Liverpool have been the most consistent - averaging at around 2.2 points per game throughout almost the entire campaign. City drew three in a row from mid-November before losing 1-0 at Aston Villa. However, Guardiola's side are on a six-game win streak since Christmas as they look to see out the campaign in customary, dominant form. Arteta's side suffered the most recent dip, losing three in five games during the festive period, but have bounced back to perfect levels with four successive wins - with an aggregate scoreline of 16-2. The chart below reveals Saka's form is crucial for the Gunners' chances of pipping City and Liverpool to the post come May. Indeed, the England winger currently sits top of the Sky Sports Power Rankings - in both the season and current form charts. The graphic below shows each team's upcoming Premier League fixtures, but which side has the easiest schedule?  The chart below plots those opponents in a table with the brightest red shade indicating the toughest opposition, based on current league position - which, right now, is Liverpool. City's average opponent ranks 9.6 in the table, which is significantly tougher than Liverpool (11.2) and Arsenal's (11.1) average opponent. However, as the table below clearly shows, both sides need to take advantage of easier opposition in the next seven games before facing trickier challenges in the final seven games - particularly Liverpool. So, what's the verdict? Well, City have the toughest league schedule on paper - but their experience at gruelling run-ins could shine through. Liverpool: FA Cup, Carabao Cup & Europa League
Man City: FA Cup & Champions League
Arsenal: Champions League Data providers Opta calculate City have a 65 per cent chance of winning an unprecedented, fourth successive league title this season, while Liverpool (25 per cent) and Arsenal (10 per cent) are notably less favoured. Our readers on WhatsApp believe it will be neck and neck between Liverpool and City - but Klopp's side edge it with 42 per cent of the votes.

74,Jones Knows best bets: Back Declan Rice to assist William Saliba or Gabriel at 11/1,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/13072851/jones-knows-best-bets-back-declan-rice-to-assist-william-saliba-or-gabriel-at-11-1,Lewis Jones,Publish time not found,"Fresh from a 13/2 weekend winning treble, Jones Knows is back in the tipping chair and is backing Arsenal's set-piece threat at Burnley. We were due one weren't we? After near miss after near miss across the season, finally the best-bet treble landed at a juicy 13/2 to give us a profit of +4.5 for the weekend and edge us closer to being in the green for the season. Enzo Fernandez didn't half make us sweat though to deliver on his two or more shots in Chelsea's win over Crystal Palace. With the Darwin Nunez offside and BTTS and over 2.5 goals in Luton's clash with Sheffield United already in the bag, Fernandez took until the 94th minute to fire his second shot of the game - the third goal - and leave me dancing around my living room. Don't get too up, don't get too down is usually my modus operandi but this winner felt good. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Of course, there was still frustration to be had. Morgan Gibbs-White racked up an expected goals tally of 0.31 from his three shots against Newcastle but couldn't land the 6/1 anytime scorer punt, while the over 4.5 goal angle in Luton vs Sheffield United at 9/2 looked in a great position with the score at 1-3 to Sheffield United with 18 minutes plus added time left. But no late goal came. Fiddlesticks. I think this is a cracker - arguably, one of the most exciting punts of the season so far, hence my double stakes. Download the Sky Sports App Watch Premier League highlights Arsenal have scored a league-high 16 goals from set-pieces, including scoring twice in the 3-1 win over Burnley from corners. My colleague Sam Blitz broke down Arsenal's set-piece prowess earlier this week - well worth a watch below. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Declan Rice has become a key part of Arsenal's strength from dead balls. Rice only took three corners in the first 20 Premier League games. Since then, he has taken 12 corners in four games and provided three assists from set-pieces, two of them coming against West Ham. His inswinging deliveries from the left are usually on point. Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford has been exposed by such tactics this season under the high ball so I'm firmly expecting Rice to provide opportunities for William Saliba, who scored in the corresponding fixture, and the bulldozing Gabriel, who has scored three times in the Premier League this season. I'm looking to combine both angles and would advise taking the 11/1 on Rice providing an assist for either Saliba or Gabriel. Wolves are smart and streetwise enough to extend Tottenham's run without a clean sheet and I can't resist the 5/1 with Sky Bet on offer for Pedro Neto to score anytime. His ability to move with great electricity with the ball is bound to expose Spurs in wide areas and no Premier League player is averaging more shots from fast breaks per 90 than Neto this season (0.65). In his last five game since returning from injury he's posted 12 shots, six of them on target and scored two goals. With Matheus Cunha out, he'll be tasked with the responsibility of leading the Wolves charge in forward areas and chances should fall his way against this opponent. Hopefully winning trebles will be like London buses. This certainly has a chance. We start, always dangerously, with the early kick-off. Liverpool may have only conceded 13 goals on the road - the second-best defensive record in the Premier League, but the underlying metrics point to an overachievement on that front. The chances they've shipped, using the expected goals against model, shows a result of 19.11 - an overperformance of six goals. That per 90 average of 1.59 expected goals against is only the fifth best in the Premier League - even Everton (1.54) sit above them on that front. A regression could be on the horizon, so Brentford are capable of scoring twice, especially with their main man Ivan Toney back and among the goals. Of course, it's hard to keep the Liverpool attack quiet too - they've scored three or more goals in 11 of their last 24 Premier League games. Goals look on the menu so backing both teams to score and over 2.5 goals around 4/5 with Sky Bet looks a winner in waiting. On the three previous occasions David Moyes' West Ham side have conceded five or more goals in a game, the very next game has seen West Ham win without conceding a goal. Keeping along those lines, my eyes have been drawn to the 6/5 with Sky Bet on offer on 'no' in the both teams to score market vs Nottingham Forest which does seem generous when you factor in the likely ultra-defensive approach on show from West Ham. They won't allow Forest to unleash many counter-attacks. It's a bet that would have copped in nine of West Ham's last 13 fixtures. I think it'll go in again. And finally, Luton look a fantastic bet to win more corners than United at a juicy 11/8 with Sky Bet. Regular readers will know all about how the Luton corner lines have spiked recently to the extent that they've won more corners than the opposition in seven of their last eight matches across all competitions. The aggregate corner count over those fixtures reads Luton 64-29 Opposition. A pummelling. United's low corner count in away fixtures against bottom-half teams also offers further confidence behind a Luton corner win. In their last 15 matches against bottom-half teams on the road, United have won just four of the corner counts with the aggregate score reading Man Utd 64-88 Opposition. They've also only won six or more corners in just two of those 15 fixtures. The lines look all wrong, so there's huge value to be had backing Luton to win the corner count.

""As the Southampton No 26 makes a run into the box, he goes down after contact between him and the Huddersfield defender. At full speed, it looks as if he may have been barged to the ground, but as can be seen from the replay the Huddersfield player gets his body in the way as they compete and doesn't commit a foul. Stream the EFL on NOW Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp ""Because the referee was so well positioned, he can see that the contact was normal football contact, in keeping with the high threshold for penalising, and he therefore correctly awards a corner kick.""

""As the ball deflects into his path, he deliberately moves his arm towards the ball and uses it to divert the ball into the goal. Although the situation happens quickly, the replays show clearly that the Leeds player raises his arm and deliberately handles the ball, therefore this goal should have been disallowed and a yellow card shown. ""Whilst match officials need a high degree of certainty to disallow goals, there is no doubt they will be disappointed that they didn't detect this offence at the time."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Incident: Goal scored - possible offside (Plymouth Argyle)Decision: No offside - goal awarded (Plymouth Argyle) Foy says: ""The decision by the assistant referee to keep his flag down here is an excellent one, as the initial camera angle gives the impression that it may have been an offside offence. ""As the long ball is played down the pitch, the assistant referee has to make a decision as to whether or not the Plymouth No 9 was in his own half at the point of contact. Despite it looking like he was offside on initial viewing, the replay clearly shows that the attacker was in his own half when the ball was played, meaning that he was onside.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Incident: Potential penalty - handball (Reading) Decision: Penalty not awarded (Reading) Foy says: ""Charlton Athletic were fortunate here not to concede a penalty as the ball strikes the No 3 on the arm. ""As there are so many players in close proximity, the referee has to be absolutely certain that it comes off the hand/arm of the Charlton player and also evaluate whether any contact between the arm and ball is punishable. ""The replays show that even though the ball reaches him somewhat unexpectedly, the defender clearly moves his right arm, making his body bigger, preventing the ball progressing past him, and the laws say that this should be given as a penalty."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Incident: Goal scored - potential offside (Barnsley) Decision: Goal awarded (Barnsley) Foy says: ""The decision to keep the flag down here is absolutely the correct one, and an excellent judgement from the assistant referee. ""Because the ball is played from deep and there are a number of runners, the assistant has more than one player to focus on. The Barnsley No 30 is the player that puts the ball in the net, and as you can see, he times his run to perfection.

The 53-year-old will lead the Three Lions into his fourth major tournament this summer in Germany having taken charge in September 2016. Southgate is the fourth-longest serving England manager behind Sir Bobby Robson, Sir Alf Ramsey and Walter Winterbottom, and has not managed at club level since 2009 - but is a return to domestic football inevitable?

Does he miss anything about club management? ""I don't really think about it that much,"" he said.

78,St Johnstone 0-1 Hearts: Lawrence Shankland strikes again to secure Jambos win,https://www.skysports.com/football/st-jstone-vs-hearts/report/487739,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Lawrence Shankland scored his 50th goal for Hearts as the rampant Edinburgh side tightened their grip on third spot in the Scottish Premiership with a 1-0 win away to St Johnstone. The Jambos captain struck for the 22nd time this season early in the second half to settle a tightly-contested affair at McDiarmid Park and secure a sixth consecutive victory in all competitions. Hearts have now won 12 of their last 15 league matches since the start of November and remain 12 points clear of nearest challengers Kilmarnock. Saints boss Craig Levein - a two-time former Jambos manager - made one alteration to the side that won 1-0 at Ross County on Saturday as Oludare Olufunwa replaced David Keltjens. There were three changes to the Hearts team that started the 3-2 victory at Dundee, with Toby Sibbick, Jorge Grant and Yutaro Oda making way for Stephen Kingsley, Kenneth Vargas and on-loan Charlton midfielder Scott Fraser, who made his debut as a substitute at the weekend. Hearts controlled possession in the early exchanges but struggled to get a clear sight of goal. Stephen Kingsley had their first notable attempt in the 25th minute after Frankie Kent headed Fraser's cross down to the edge of the six-yard box but his firm, angled strike was blocked by Dimitar Mitov. Saints started to grow into the game as the half wore on and they had an opportunity in the 39th minute when Alex Cochrane's headed clearance dropped to Benjamin Kimpioka just inside the box, but the Swedish striker was unable to get the ball fully under control and sliced his effort wide. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Hearts threatened in the last minute of the half but Vargas headed wide after getting on the end of Dexter Lembikisa's cross from the right at the back post. Saints made a change for the start of the second half as Sven Sprangler replaced fellow midfielder Fran Franczak. Connor Smith, who left Hearts in January to join the Perth side, tried his luck with a shot from distance in the 47th minute but it was easily held by Zander Clark. A minute later Jambos winger Alan Forrest went agonisingly close to breaking the deadlock when he curled a low 12-yard shot just past the far post from the left side of the box. The breakthrough came for the visitors in the 55th minute when Saints defender Andrew Considine misjudged Kent's long ball up the centre of the pitch and Shankland - alert to the opportunity - flicked the ball beyond Ryan McGowan to get himself free in the box before calmly slotting past Mitov from around 12 yards. It was the Scotland striker's 50th goal since joining Hearts from Belgian club Beerschot in the summer of 2022. Saints - who remain 10th in the table - had two good chances to equalise in the closing stages through Nicky Clark and Adama Sidibeh, but Steven Naismith's on-form side held firm.

""That's partly down to him and the team, he's a lethal finisher. He's got the finesse and the touch to take his chances when they come along. ""He's showed why he's the best striker in the league.

""The fact we lost 1-0 to a good Hearts side, with Lawrence Shankland scoring a goal that I don't think anyone else on the field would have a chance of scoring, the way we played pleases me.

Alan Forrest (Hearts) - 8.42 rating Hearts twice battled from a goal down to eventually beat Dundee 3-2 at Dens Park. Alan Forrest scored Hearts' first on the day, netting 10 minutes into the second half from one of four shots, and was unfortunate not to add an assist having made four key passes to feature in the best XI with a WhoScored.com rating of 8.42. 3. Caolan Boyd-Munce (St. Mirren) - 8.42 rating Back to Easter Road and Caolan Boyd-Munce, like Forrest, also earned a WhoScored.com rating of 8.42 on Saturday as the central midfielder claimed the player of the match award. Boyd-Munce was directly involved in two of St Mirren's three goals, providing assists for Alex Gogic and Mandron to score, with his brace of assists coming from four key passes. A further two tackles, two interceptions and two clearances marked the 24-year-old's best-rated performance of the season. 2. James Tavernier (Rangers) - 9.18 rating Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rangers closed the gap at the top of the table to just three points with a 3-0 victory over Livingston, with skipper James Tavernier once again shining. While the right-back was unable to directly contribute to a goal, it wasn't for want of trying as the 32-year-old made five key passes and fired off one shot. Tavernier also won nine aerial duels and made three tackles in a fine showing. 1. Lawrence Shankland (Hearts) - 9.43 rating Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Boasting a WhoScored.com rating of 9.43, Hearts hitman Lawrence Shankland is the Scottish Premiership player of the week. Shankland was directly involved in all three goals in Hearts' 3-2 win at Dundee, netting with two of eight shots and providing one assist with one key pass. The 28-year-old also made one clearance off the line on his way to a player of the match award.

81,"Jorginho excels as Arsenal overcome Liverpool, Man Utd finally back up a big win, Mauricio Pochettino under pressure - Premier League hits and misses",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/13063919/man-utd-finally-back-up-a-big-win-but-mauricio-pochettino-must-be-fireproof-as-chelsea-fans-turn-up-the-heat-premier-league-hits-and-misses,Author not found,Publish time not found," Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was ""unbelievable"" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a ""streetwise"" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho. ""I always say that he is an example, a role model,"" said the Arsenal manager. ""He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him."" The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods. His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else. The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion. The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. ""One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks."" He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later. In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season. The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism. Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier. Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around. There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season. But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale. For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse. Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06. There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails. In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over. Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank. In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end. Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display. Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession. Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back. The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts. Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager. Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge. Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious. After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. ""Yes, it could have been more,"" he said. This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break. Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints. The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though. By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers. Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

82,Green Football Weekend returns: Help your club fight against climate change,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/12801274/green-football-weekend-returns-help-your-club-fight-against-climate-change,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Sky Sports is once again backing Green Football Weekend as the world's largest climate-football campaign returns for a second year. Across the weekend of February 2-5, clubs will take centre stage as part of Green Football Weekend, taking part in greener games to showcase their sustainability work, engaging fans in the issue and announcing new, more ambitious commitments. The world's largest climate-football campaign mobilises fans, clubs, leagues and partners to take action on climate. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The campaign will focus on the power of veg to help protect our world; encouraging fans to try cooking a veggie meal and working with clubs and caterers to put on delicious veggie and plant-based food for matchday fans. The future of football is at risk due to the effects of climate change, with 150,000 games already cancelled per year due to pitch flooding. By 2050, a quarter of UK football grounds will be flooded, with one in four teams expecting partial or total stadium flooding each year. From January 18 to February 5, fans can go to greenfootballweekend.com to score green goals for their football club, by pledging to make a green switch or taking a green action. Every green goal fans score will help their club climb up the leader board to help them win the Green Football Cup. Sarah Jacobs, Green Football Weekend director, said: ""Green Football Weekend is fan action at its most powerful, and brings clubs together to take increasingly ambitious action on climate. ""Football has incredible power to inspire change and improve lives, and that's what this campaign is all about."" Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Sky Sports is once again backing Green Football Weekend and will use its platform to support the campaign through editorial features and creative coverage. Sky Sports is involved in Green Football Weekend to raise awareness of climate change, and show the small ways football fans, and everyone, can make changes to their lifestyles which can add up to make a big difference. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This is part of Sky Sports and Sky Zero's ongoing commitment to help fans look after the sports they love and make sure there is always a place to play. Gary Hughes, Director of Football at Sky Sports, said: ""It's a privilege to once again be involved in Green Football Weekend and use the game we all love to help protect our planet. ""At Sky Sports, we're committed to helping fans look after the sports they love and make sure there is always a place to play.

I saw what it meant to the local community and so I stepped in to make it financially sustainable, because I didn't want to see it fold. I had to make a lot of changes, to align the club with my environmental principles and in that I saw the opportunity to do something much bigger. It was a chance to talk to an entirely new audience about the environment. This would most definitely not be preaching to the choir - and that added to the appeal. Now Forest Green Rovers is known as the greenest football club in the world. We've shown there's another way to do football, but the aim isn't to be the exception. Every football club should be a green football club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That's what Green Football Weekend is all about and that's why I'm backing it. Green Football Weekend is a campaign that unleashes the power of football to tackle climate change, bringing together clubs, fans and communities to have fun and take action on climate. It's simple - Football is a big cultural force. It's the biggest sport in the world reaching billions of passionate fans. And football fans take notice of what their clubs and stars do. If we can harness some of that passion and point it towards the environment, we can create change on the scale needed - from the grass roots if you like. I've seen it work at FGR where our fans have embraced the green agenda of the club. Football fans can easily make changes that reduce their own impact, and football is a great way to communicate with them and show them how. We have woven sustainability into the DNA of FGR and we created a new kind of football club - one where the environment and football have equal importance - and a new kind of football fan as a consequence. Last year Green Football Weekend reached over 30 million fans and in February 2024 we're going even bigger, with more than 80 clubs across the top leagues getting involved. It's driven by an amazing set of partners including Sky Sports, TNT Sports and the Football Supporters Association, and is backed by the FA, EFL and WSL. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's happening from the 2nd to the 5th of February and the focus is food. Because what we eat matters. It matters for our health and for the health of the planet. It's one of the biggest and easiest ways for fans and clubs to make a difference, but there are also loads of benefits to eating less meat and more veg, from preventing injuries to improving recovery times. And it tastes great too - just ask our fans at FGR where food sales are something like 10 times higher than before we went plant based. We've certainly been on a journey with food at FGR. We've been fully vegan since 2014 but we didn't do it overnight. It was a gradual process and we took our fans with us. It's one many areas where they've embraced another way of doing things. Now it's probably what we're known for most and it's been fun. It was at Wembley at the full-time whistle when we were promoted to the football league, that BBC commentator Bob Hunt minted his legendary quote live on air when he exclaimed, 'Swindon, Cheltenham, Bristol Rovers, let me tell you this, next season you'll be eating hummus because Forest Green Rovers are in the Football League.' Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That was fun and felt like a big win, given the scepticism and ridicule at the outset. But the bigger wins on this front have been when visiting fans like our food so much they ask their own clubs to change the menu. The proof of the pudding if you like. I know it can feel a bit challenging to some people, to contemplate plant based food, I've seen it - I like to point out that chips are vegan, it surprises a surprising amount of people. Plant based food is quite normal. But while clubs and their fans can make a huge difference, we can't leave it to them alone. We need the government to do their bit too. That's why we're is calling for the new independent football regulator to be responsible for environmental sustainability as well as financial sustainability. Both of these issues are vital to football and we can't properly have one without the other. Along with the whole of the Green Britain Group, I'm backing Green Football Weekend. So, come February 2nd, when you join me on the terraces, think about what you're eating and how you can do your bit for the planet. And if all else fails, just get some chips.

83,Lazio 1-0 Bayern Munich: Ciro Immobile puts Italians ahead in Champions League last-16 tie as Dayot Upamecano sees red,https://www.skysports.com/football/lazio-vs-bay-munich/report/501463,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane has called on his side to keep fighting after Ciro Immobile's penalty gave Lazio a 1-0 win in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Rome. Immobile converted his 69th-minute spot-kick after Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano's clumsy challenge on Gustav Isaksen for which the France international was sent off with a straight red card. Disciplined Lazio stifled the German side's attacks and Bayern were toothless throughout, failing to register a single effort on target in the game. Bayern, who also lost at the weekend to Bundesliga title rivals Bayer Leverkusen, now have work to do if they are to reach the Champions League quarter-finals and Kane says it is up to the players to turn around their stuttering form. Kane told TNT Sports: ""Really tough week. In the first half, we started well and had clear chances, one for myself. In these games, they're big moments. ""The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. We got punished. Once you go down to 10 men it's always difficult. ""We have to find it among ourselves. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga and still in this tie. We have to keep fighting. How the teams lined up Champions League fixtures Champions League results Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! ""We're in a difficult spell. We have to fight. We have to turn it around. We have big games and big things to fight for. We're not out of it, we will never give up. We just need to turn it around. One game or spark can turn it around."" The Bavarians were desperate to bounce back from Saturday's 3-0 Bundesliga loss to leaders Bayer Leverkusen which left them five points off the top, but they will return to Munich with more pressure piling on head coach Thomas Tuchel after his side's second straight defeat. Bayern have also now failed to score in their last two games but Tuchel, who struggled to explain his side's worrying form, played down concerns about his position after the match. ""Worried about my future? No, I am not,"" he said. ""We're frustrated and angry about the defeat. I think we lost the game, I'm not sure Lazio won it. ""I'm not sure why we lost our conviction in the second half, but we did, and then we fell behind. I can't explain it because we told the team to maintain their intensity and be even braver going forward, but we seemed to lose face at the start of the half. ""There are things we can build on. In the first half, we created some good chances, some big chances and one huge one with Jamal (Musiala), but in the end, we didn't have a single shot on target, so it's clear you can't win a game like that. ""But we've got a second leg and, obviously in conjunction with the last result, it doesn't look great, but we'll keep working hard."" Soon after the match, Bayern Munich issued a statement to ""strongly condemn"" racist abuse aimed at defender Dayot Upamecano on social media following his red card.


""FC Bayern strongly condemn the racist comments being directed towards Dayot Upamecano on social media,"" the club said.


""Anyone who comments hateful words such as these is no fan of our club. We’re all behind you, Upa!"" Bayern started well as they pressed the Italians high and created chances for Joshua Kimmich, Harry Kane and Leroy Sane in the first half, who all narrowly missed the target. Lazio, who had lost 6-2 on aggregate to Bayern at this stage three years ago, went close with a Luis Alberto shot that flew wide of Manuel Neuer's goal. The tempo gradually dropped, Bayern struggled with the disciplined Italian back line and had to wait until the 40th minute to threaten again with Jamal Musiala firing over the bar from close range. Lazio should have taken the lead two minutes after the restart when Isaksen only had Neuer to beat but the goalkeeper stood his ground to block his shot. The Dane earned a penalty when Immobile passed to Isaksen in the box and Upamecano arrived late and stepped on his ankle. Immobile kept his cool and sent Neuer the wrong way to give his team the advantage going into the return leg in Munich on March 5. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former England defender Danny Mills on Sky Sports News: ""Lazio came out even more determined in the second half. They were so dogged in their defending, and were very well organised. Bayern are just lacking something - that No 8 or No 10 to create chances and do something a little bit different in those tight areas against compact defences. ""Harry Kane was pretty much anonymous in the second half. One free-kick he had hit the top of the wall and went over - that was it. Immobile's penalty was very calm under pressure. I'm not convinced it's a red card for Upamecano, but it is a penalty. He's a fraction late and he ends up landing on Isaksen's ankle. ""Lazio will be absolutely delighted but Thomas Tuchel will be under severe pressure. At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. Lazio outworked them in the second half and it's going to be a tough game in Munich."" Lazio face a crunch game in the race for Europe with fifth-placed Bologna on Sunday, kick-off 11.30am. Their visitors sit three places, but only two points, ahead of them in the Serie A table. Bayern Munich travel to Bochum, live on Sky Sports, on Sunday afternoon as they look to get their Bundesliga title hopes back on track following defeat by Bayer Leverkusen last weekend, kick-off 4.30pm.

84,Millwall 0-4 Ipswich: Tractor Boys thump Lions to return to winning ways,https://www.skysports.com/football/millwall-vs-ipswich/report/485081,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Ipswich moved to within three points of the Sky Bet Championship automatic promotion places as they returned to winning ways by thrashing struggling Millwall 4-0. Kieran McKenna's early season challengers had won just one in nine league games but survived a slow start to run out deserved victors at The Den. Nathan Broadhead scored one and made another in the first half while in-form Bournemouth loanee Kieffer Moore headed home and Ali Al-Hamadi converted a stoppage-time penalty as Ipswich eased to just a second league win of the calendar year. Despite their drop-off in form, McKenna's side lost just twice in that run and the former Manchester United assistant will be hoping this result heralds a return to form - with a trip to Swansea next up on Saturday. Millwall started the better of the two sides and the recalled Ryan Leonard hammered an effort over the crossbar after an early corner was cleared to the edge of the Ipswich box. The home side showed four changes from their loss at Coventry and another returnee came close on four minutes as George Saville's drive was saved by Vaclav Hladky. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  With the hosts on top, Tom Bradshaw should have done better as the Lions countered an Ipswich corner but the ball got caught under his feet and Harrison Clarke got back to clear. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Hladky was forced into action again to save low from Leonard as Millwall maintained their head of steam. But despite their dominance, Joe Edwards' men fell behind at the midway point of the first half with Broadhead's accurate back-header from Omari Hutchinson's cross putting Ipswich ahead against the run of play. The lead was doubled soon after as Harding inadvertently turned Broadhead's low cross into his own goal. The points were all-but secured on the stroke of half-time, Moore heading into the ground and over Sarkic for his third goal in as many games. The second half was a much more even affair as Millwall matched their visitors, who had taken their foot off the gas. Still, though, the home side could not find a way to beat Hladky, the former Salford keeper going largely untested after the interval other than preventing a Bradshaw consolation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ipswich could have extended their advantage as Wes Burns and Conor Chaplin had decent chances before referee Sam Barrott pointed to the spot for a Murray Wallace foul on substitute Al-Hamadi. The January signing from AFC Wimbledon dusted himself down to score his first goal for his new club. While Ipswich continue to look up, Edwards has now seen his side take just one point from their last six league games and - with Stoke and Huddersfield both winning - they have dropped to 21st in the table. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Millwall's Joe Edwards: ""It is a bit of deja vu, we started well with a clear plan that the players were executing. ""Their goalkeeper had a few saves to make early on. When you play against a team like Ipswich's level, they can score goals at any time but the manner of that (first) goal can't happen. ""It is a combination of things that throws us, we were feeling in a good place, with momentum and then the wind is taken out of your sails with a poor goal and from there until half time it just unravelled."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ipswich's Kieran McKenna: ""I think we are long due a night like that to be honest. Statistically, in the last nine games we have been creating more shots and having less against than in the first nine games but sometimes football works like that. ""We were clinical and we produced the defensive moments whenever we needed to, we have been long overdue a night where things went our way. ""It was a good night's work, a good performance in different areas. I thought we were solid in free play and controlled large chunks of the game with the ball, created a few good opportunities and were really clinical when they came.""

Eagles fans also unfurled banners criticising Steve Parish and the board during their side's 4-1 defeat at rivals Brighton on Saturday - just as they had after losing 5-0 at Arsenal last month. Palace were the top-spending Premier League side in January but have won just twice in their last 14 games in all competitions and sit only five points above the relegation zone. Asked what it was like to hear Brighton supporters' taunts as Palace fans chanted for him to leave the club, Hodgson sarcastically responded: ""Wonderful, wasn't it?

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Hodgson defended the Palace players for going over to the away fans at full-time - something that prompted an angry response from many of the supporters that had remained until the final whistle. Joachim Andersen appeared to get into a heated discussion with one section of the support and Hodgson admitted: ""The fans are going to be very unhappy after seeing their team losing 4-1, so if you go over there you run the risk. ""You have to show the discipline not to bite back. I think the players did the right thing. ""We are happy the fans have come to support today. No one is less happy than ourselves with the result but at least they went over to thank the fans."" Hodgson also defended Parish, who helped to save Palace from administration 14 years ago, telling Sky Sports: ""I think Steve Parish has done a fantastic job for the club. ""People's memories should be jogged. The club was in an awful state when he came with his partners at the time. They've turned the club around and got us into the Premiership and at the moment we're still there and fighting to stay there. ""It's not for me really to talk about the club structure and the ownership of the club - that's something you'd have to take up with Steve himself. ""But if you're asking me personally, as someone working for Steve Parish and the club, I think it's very harsh people are putting up banners in that way and trying to blame him for the fact we've lost a game against Brighton."" Palace were already without Cheikh Doucoure and Eberechi Eze for the trip to Brighton, while Olise was not fit enough to start and Marc Guehi limped off during the first half. Olise's status was doubtful due to a knock he sustained in the win over Sheffield United in midweek, while Hodgson has previously discussed the difficulties of balancing the demands of the team with his medical staff, saying he can't run the side ""scientifically"". Olise was introduced at half-time but lasted less than 10 minutes before suffering a recurrence of his hamstring injury, but Hodgson defended his use of the winger. ""I was told that he couldn’t start the game and I was quite comfortable with that,"" Hodgson said. ""They told me - and he told me - that he was fine to be on the bench and to play in the second half. ""Unfortunately I wasn’t to know that was going to lead to a recurrence of his injury. That’s exactly what we did. ""You can say ‘you were losing 3-0, why put one of your better players on?’ But it’s because we bought him all the way here to be on the field in the second half."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread at the Amex Stadium: Crystal Palace are at a crossroads. For so long, mid-table stability, combined with developing a smattering of exciting young players, has been enough for the south Londoners. Much of that stability has been provided by Steve Parish, whose backing helped to bring the club up from the Championship, and Roy Hodgson, who has done so much across two spells to keep the Eagles in the Premier League. But now many of the supporters want more. Shorn of Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise for much of the season, Palace have slipped to just five points above the relegation zone, while winning just two of their last 14 games. Hodgson's side have conceded nine goals in their last two away games, both of which saw fans turn on Parish and the board. January's investment in Adam Wharton and Daniel Munoz doesn't appear to have placated the fanbase. With Hodgson aged 76 and only having a contract until the end of the season, a change in the dugout is surely coming sooner rather than later. But what then? Palace only have the 12th-highest net spend over the past five seasons and have been missing arguably their three best players - Eze, Olise and Cheikh Doucoure - for huge chunks of the campaign. Is it fair to ask them to be achieving any more than they already are? Palace supporters may want to be careful what they wish for.

The Ligue 1 side accused the Hammers of ""incomprehensible behaviour"" and a ""lack of respect"" after the move failed to be completed late on Deadline Day. However, Lyon CEO Laurent Prud'homme later said FIFA had validated the club's request for an international transfer certificate with the deal finally announced on Friday. Sky Sports News understands West Ham are hugely disappointed with the claims made by Lyon on Thursday night which have been described as ""wholly inaccurate and potentially damaging"". Sources close to the club have told Sky Sports News claims made by Lyon of a profound lack of respect and incomprehensible behaviour are completely unfounded, as the resolution of this deal shows. The deal is now confirmed and is a loan with an option to make the transfer permanent in the summer, worth more than £15m in total. Benrahma travelled to Lyon in a bid to complete the move before the French window closed at 10pm on Thursday. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Download the Sky Sports App However, despite Lyon claiming the deal was agreed upon, the move failed to be completed at the last minute with the French club blaming West Ham for the breakdown. A statement released by the French club said: ""Olympique Lyonnais were delighted to welcome Said Benrahma to Lyon this Thursday to finalize his transfer from West Ham. The two clubs had signed a temporary transfer agreement, and Olympique Lyonnais had obtained approval from the DNCG to allow the transfer to take place smoothly and transparently. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""However, at the start of the evening, while Olympique Lyonnais had entered all the administrative data on the dedicated FIFA platform (FIFA TMS), West Ham had never launched the slightest technical procedure on its part, despite the repeated reminders from the OL and continuous mutual telephone communication. ""In the absence of this reciprocal action on the part of the English club and following this incomprehensible behaviour, raising questions, the international transfer certificate could not be requested before closing time. ""Olympique Lyonnais deeply regrets this situation and this decision, demonstrating a profound lack of respect on the part of West Ham towards the institution and the player. ""The club reserves the right to initiate all appropriate procedures necessary to validate the transaction at a later date, and to hold West Ham responsible if necessary."" West Ham responded with a statement of their own: ""West Ham United can confirm that the Deadline Day deal for Said Benrahma to join Olympique Lyonnais was not concluded ahead of the deadline, with a deal unable to be completed before 11pm."" West Ham confirmed on Friday that Pablo Fornals has joined Real Betis on a permanent transfer for an undisclosed fee. The 27-year-old returns to Spain after four-and-a-half seasons with the Hammers. He made 203 appearances and scored 23 goals in east London. Real Betis had claimed a computer problem initially scuppered their bid to sign Fornals from the Hammers. The Spain midfielder had agreed a £7m switch to the LaLiga club on deadline day, but the deal failed to go through. Betis CEO Ramon Alarcon was hopeful the Fornals deal would still go through, however. He told Spanish reporters: ""There was a last-minute problem with Fornals, we think it was a computer problem. ""Betis sent all the documents correctly and on time and it seems West Ham had a computer problem. It wasn't just with Betis it was with other deals. We hope that it gets resolved in the next few days. ""It was done on both sides. We imagine that with a computer error it can be resolved. We are working on it and we are optimistic.""

89,"Ivory Coast win AFCON 2023: Emerse Fae, Sebastien Haller, Simon Adingra help hosts turn fairytale into reality",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13070050/ivory-coast-win-afcon-2023-emerse-fae-sebastien-haller-simon-adingra-help-hosts-turn-fairytale-into-reality,Ron Walker,Publish time not found,"It was just the perfect football fairytale. Victory clutched from the jaws of defeat. The winning goalscorer firing his side to glory 18 months after a cancer diagnosis. The victorious manager farcically appointed after his predecessor was sacked mid-tournament. The Ivory Coast weren't even supposed to be here. A 4-0 hammering by Equatorial Guinea, the 88th best team in the world, ended the hosts' group stage in such humiliation coach Jean-Louis Gasset was sent packing before their fate was decided. They needed late equalisers to keep both their last-16 and quarter-final games alive. But something was written in the stars in Abidjan on Sunday night. Poetic moments aren't unusual in football, but rarely with this much symmetry. The Ivory Coast fans swelling the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in the country's second city could barely believe it themselves as they watched their dream turn to reality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There were questions how any side who finished third in a group of four could be allowed to progress all the way to the Africa Cup of Nations final, let alone win it. But those have been put aside amidst one of the greatest stories in AFCON history, against the almightiest of odds. Ivory Coast had won only one game in 90 minutes coming into Sunday's final, but dominated clear favourites Nigeria from the first minute to the last. They still had to do things the hard way, recovering from William Troost-Ekong's first-half header to eventually win 2-1 with Sebastien Haller the perfect protagonist. This was a night for unlikely heroes. Nigeria 1-2 Ivory Coast report AFCON results Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW It was only August 2022 when the 29-year-old striker was admitted to hospital with testicular cancer, weeks after signing for Borussia Dortmund. It took two surgeries, four cycles of chemotherapy and eight months away from football before he was eventually fit enough to return last January. He had played down his recovery as ""challenging"" ahead of the final but even then admitted to the room of journalists, ""given what has happened over the last few months, it's great to be here in front of you."" Injury had cruelly ruled him out of much of this tournament too, before he returned to start the semi-final and final. Sunday night was the ultimate reward, prodding home Simon Adingra's cross 10 minutes from time to write his name into history. He burst into tears in his post-match interview, the magnitude of how far he has come too much to bear. ""We dreamed of this moment so many times,"" Haller said after regaining his composure. ""The joyous scenes we see now, what's happening in the country, they deserve it too. I really hope it does a lot of people good."" Haller's story is the crowning glory of the tournament. Interim manager Emerse Fae's is not quite so remarkable though still makes history in its own way. The 40-year-old ex-Reading defender started the tournament as assistant to Gasset, before he was thrust into the limelight once the Frenchman was dismissed in disgrace. Gasset was fired hours before Zambia's defeat to Morocco ensured they would sneak into the knock-out stages as one of the four best third-placed sides, in spite of their performances. Fae was one of his assistants but had never managed a senior side. He was not the man many wanted. On paper, he certainly was not the man to turn around a fast-sinking ship at several days' notice. He had experienced plenty of pain with his country as a player. He was part of the golden-era side beaten in the 2006 final by Egypt, and thrashed in the semi-finals by the same opponent two years later. Some players are able to positively channel that pain through management. Fae was not the man with the CV, but he was the man who understood what his country needed. He kept the demands of his players simple. An opportunity to succeed where he had failed. ""We were close to humiliation but when we had a second chance, we were determined not to waste it,"" he said. A penalty shoot-out win over high-flying Senegal, after a late equaliser to salvage their tournament again, rebuilt some national pride. Adingra left it even later to send their quarter-final with Mali to extra-time, where they eventually emerged victorious despite playing for almost 80 minutes with 10 players. Beating DR Congo 1-0 in the semi-finals might have felt unusually drab. It was the Ivory Coast's first win in 90 minutes since their opening match, and was enough to earn the monicker 'The Special One', 20 years after Jose Mourinho first coined the term. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He might keep it for himself now. His side had shown grit to reach the final, but he led them to a performance of real quality on Sunday to complete their stunning rise from the ashes. ""When I think about all we went through, the hard times when we were almost out and the matches where we came back in last minutes, we have created some miracles,"" Fae said after he was named coach of the tournament. Haller was his hero, while Adingra grew to become his country's driving force. The final was only the 22-year-old's 10th international cap, and just his second start of the tournament. He has become an overnight sensation. Few get fans off their seat like the flying winger - it was his corner which was nodded home by Franck Kessie to cancel out Nigeria's opener. And his driving run and cross which was turned home for the winner. ""I've just experienced one of the most beautiful moments of my life and that's down to the effort of everyone in the team,"" he said afterwards. This is just the start of his football journey, almost six months to the day since he made his Premier League debut. Plenty more nights like these will follow. But for the Ivory Coast, their next AFCON title will have to be pretty special to match this. Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."
90,West Brom 2-0 Cardiff: Michael Johnston and Alex Mowatt steer Baggies to victory,https://www.skysports.com/football/w-brom-vs-cardiff/report/485085,Author not found,Publish time not found,"January signings Mikey Johnston and Andreas Weimann scored in either half as West Brom beat Cardiff 2-0 for a fifth straight Championship home win. Johnston struck inside the first minute when he turned home Tom Fellows' delivery from the right. In the 80th minute, Weimann scored his second goal in Albion colours when he rounded off a smart move involving his captain Jed Wallace. It took West Brom all of 30 seconds to open the scoring. Darnell Furlong clipped the ball down the wing for Fellows and he was afforded the space to run at Jamilu Collins before pulling the ball back into the path of the onrushing Johnston who, on his full debut for the hosts, steered tidily beyond visiting goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. The Hawthorns rose in the 12th minute to pay tribute with applause to stricken forward Daryl Dike. The United States international ruptured his Achilles in the 2-2 draw at Ipswich on Saturday and he is due for surgery and an extended period on the sidelines. Dike's team-mates had worn T-shirts with his name and number on their backs while they were warming up before kick-off. Despite the early setback, Cardiff were by no means deterred. Josh Wilson-Esbrand hit an admittedly hopeful shot tamely into Alex Palmer's arms, before Nat Phillips caused problems from a David Turnbull free-kick and sparked panic before Albion hurried a clearance. The hosts had an opening to double their advantage 25 minutes in, when the ball was worked down the left and Okay Yokuslu turned the ball into the path of midfield partner Alex Mowatt, but he could not keep his curling attempt beneath the crossbar. While the score remained at one, Cardiff were always encouraged, yet there was little to report by way of second-half action until Kion Etete passed up a glaring opportunity to level for the visitors. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Wilson-Esbrand sent a deep cross to the back post, where the ball was cushioned down by Aaron Ramsey for Etete. From inside the six-yard box, he could only lift the ball over the bar. While those Cardiff substitutes did not combine successfully, West Brom's did. With 10 minutes remaining, Albion broke through Nathaniel Chalobah who set loose winger Wallace down the right. His cross was pinpoint for Weimann, who rolled the ball home to make the points secure. West Brom's Carlos Corberan: ""It's necessary to have these options. It's something key, because if you don't rotate the players, at the end you have more injuries. ""For us, as a club, it was necessary for us to add more attacking options, because we needed to increase the options we had. Right now, we're using the players, because it's necessary to have that impact from the bench. ""Our players now know that we have now good options. They believe in the team-mates they have. Our attacking players know that if they're not at 100 per cent, we have others who will be. They understand it's a strength we have and must use. ""It can never be a problem, to have two or three players competing in every position - now we have those alternatives."" Cardiff's Erol Bulut: ""It's difficult when you concede a goal in the first minute against West Brom, who are at home, with quality players. ""It's not easy but we pushed really hard, especially in the second half, we had chances to score and make it 1-1, with Kion and with Ramsey. ""If you don't score, it's normal that at the end they get the second one, because we were pushing to get the second one. ""Opponents, when they get those chances they are scoring and we are not scoring. This is the difference. We have the chances, but we are not scoring.""

The Ghanaian will join the south coast club when the transfer window opens later this year. Osman has agreed a contact with the Premier League club that runs until June 2029. The 19-year-old, who can play on the left wing, right wing and also through the middle, joined FC Nordsjaelland from Ghana's Right to Dream academy - the same pathway taken by Brighton's Ivory Coast international Simon Adingra. Sky Sports News reported that West Ham tried to sign Osman in January, but a deal never materialised due to the asking price.

Rowe wins the award for the first time having joined Rangers in July and becomes the third player from the club to have won this season following Kirsty Howat and Rio Hardy.

The Championship high-fliers extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 24 matches when Che Adams teed up the 21-year-old Frenchman in the 52nd minute. Mara, who had been linked with Sheffield United in the January transfer window after making just one league start this season, doubled his tally six minutes later with his fifth goal in nine appearances, before Adams wrapped things up 14 minutes from time.

Foden hit a hat-trick as City came from behind to beat bogey team Brentford 3-1 and climb up to second in the Premier League. Victory in west London, coupled with Arsenal's win over Liverpool on Sunday, leaves Pep Guardiola's side two points behind the Reds with a game in hand. Brentford were the only team to beat City home and away last season, and the 'three-peat' looked on when Neal Maupay fired them into the lead. But Foden hauled City level before the interval, headed them in front early in the second half and then completed a stylish treble to leave the visitors with their title destiny firmly in their own hands. Speaking to Sky Sports afterwards with the match ball in his hands, Foden said: ""I'm a person that adapts and plays a lot of positions when needed. I know I will do that with Manchester City and have to be ready. I'm enjoying playing in the middle and that's where I see myself. Hopefully I can get more game time playing there.

""All I set myself is to try to better last year's stats and just try to improve every year, more goals and more assists. I need to keep going and showing this level of performance more often. I don't score a lot of headers so I'm delighted with that one."" They may have lagged behind the pace-setters for much of the season, but with Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne back from injury, and Foden in this sort of form, an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League crown looks well within their capability. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Foden added: ""We know the quality they have. [Ivan] Toney is one of the best in winning aerial duels, we knew the threat he would have. They are a fantastic team and we had to react and we did that well and I'm delighted with the outcome of the game. ""We stayed calm and we're a team that trusts our ability. There were ups and downs but we had to remain patient. They closed the spaces but we remained patient, controlled the game and created chances, which was nice to see. ""I'm really glad with my performances and am playing a lot of minutes inside, where I want to be, and I'm delighted with the way I'm playing. I'm playing the best form I've had in a City shirt consistently for a long time and long may that continue and I will keep working hard on the training ground."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  City made what feels like a significant move in the title race - and Pep Guardiola was full of praise for one man in particular. ""He has played a lot of games,"" Guardiola told Sky Sports when asked about Foden's contribution. ""He is a guy that plays different positions and has the ability in spaces and the centre of goal because he likes to arrive in the box. ""They [Brentford] are so deep, spaces are difficult so to have a player moving in these spaces is so important. He loves moving in the 18-yard box and he is playing his best season since we are together."" Later in his press conference, Guardiola was asked how much Foden could still improve. ""His limits, he will decide,"" the City boss added. ""I want as much for him to improve, football is the most important thing in his life, aside from his family and children. This season he has been so important for us. ""In terms of how he moves in small spaces and after, I've seen many players in the small spaces who are really good, but the impact - you have the feeling when he gets the ball then, he's going to score, he's going to shoot, he's going to make an assist. That's difficult to find. ""His combination of being good in the pockets but also after being like a knife. To be so, so aggressive in trying to score goals. I have seen few players like him."" Foden has been involved in 15 Premier League goals this season - only four players have amassed more goal involvements. The question now will turn to how best he can be deployed by Gareth Southgate ahead of this summer's European Championship finals in Germany. Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher told Monday Night Football: ""It's really interesting what he said about playing more centrally. In terms of natural-born talent in the England squad, you think Jude Bellingham is perhaps the only one who can go up against him. ""What Bellingham has done in the last 18 months is almost make the England team his own where the team is going to be built around him. I thought that was going to be Phil Foden two or three years ago. It hasn't quite happened. ""When he plays for City, you're never quite sure if he's going to be playing on the right, on the left or central. I don't think that's helped him. ""I think it is a bit of a conundrum for the England manager. If Bellingham is at No 10, does that mean Foden has to be on the left with Bukayo Saka on the right? The fact he's had to move positions so often has probably hindered him. ""I thought when David Silva moved on, it would be his natural next step to play more centrally as a left-footed but it didn't happen. It feels Pep Guardiola puts a lot on playing centrally and thought he could learn the game better playing wider. ""For England, there is no reason why he can't play in that position. I think criticism of Gareth Southgate being too defensive can be a little over the top, but this would be a bold move, and why not when you've got players of that quality. In Spain, he and Bellingham would play as two No 8s."" Sky Sports' Ron Walker at the Gtech Community Stadium: ""It takes some reminding that Phil Foden is still only 23 years old. The way he ghosts into space - like for his second goal - and how he glides past defenders - like for his third - are not something you would associate with a player still a few years from their prime. ""There is credence to Pep Guardiola's assertion that Foden is among the most dangerous players in tight spaces he has ever worked with. ""It always seemed like he would end up playing in a more central role at some point given that priceless quality. And now he is thriving in it. ""Haaland was the perfect foil for two of his three goals, drawing two defenders towards him on both occasions and leaving space for Foden to work his magic. Not everyone would anticipate that and react accordingly, but he is as intelligent as he is technically gifted. ""Two questions remain. Where does he fit for England - because surely, he fits somewhere - and how far can he go from here? ""At international level, the left flank seems the likely fit given his experience there for Man City and Gareth Southgate's current preference to play Jude Bellingham as his most advanced central midfielder. ""In terms of his potential, it's perhaps best to channel his club manager and mentor. 'His limits, he will decide,' Guardiola said when asked to ponder that same thought. ""Given what Foden has decided in his short career to this point, that may well mean there is still plenty more to come.""

Nigeria edged past Angola 1-0 to reach the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals thanks to a first-half goal from Ademola Lookman. The former Fulham and Everton winger crashed home the only goal of the game in the 41st minute as the Super Eagles, chasing a fourth AFCON title, came up against a determined resistance in Abidjan. Jose Peseiro's side will face Cape Verde or South Africa, who meet in Yamoussoukro on Saturday, for a place in the final. Nigeria's star striker Victor Osimhen twice went close in the first half with headers, the first when he got on the end of Moses Simon's cross but could only guide this effort into the goalkeeper's hands, then again when he nodded across goal after meeting Ola Aina's long throw. What would prove to be the winning goal arrived four minutes before half-time and Simon was the architect. Alex Iwobi began the move with a sweeping ball from right to left. Nantes winger Simon found space with a well-time run down the wing and, having carried the ball to the byline, looked up and found Lookman. He evaded the attentions of Angola's defence and hit a thumping first-time finish into the roof of the net. Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Early in the second half, Calvin Bassey took the ball off the foot of team-mate Osimhen as he sought to execute a close-range overhead kick, the Fulham player nodding over the bar after Angola failed to clear a corner, as Nigeria sought to settle the game. Minutes later, Angola came within an inch of levelling. Zini sprung Nigeria's offside trip with an expertly timed run from a defence-splitting pass. Bearing down one-on-one against Stanley Nwabali, he opened up his right foot and despatched an effort that rebounded off the inside of the post and away to safety. Osimhen thought he had made it 2-0 when his header from Bassey's free-kick went in off the post, but the goal was ruled out by VAR for offside, to the relief of Angola goalkeeper Antonio Dominique who had allowed the ball to squeeze through his hands. The Napoli striker spurned another chance to seal it with 10 minutes to play, racing on to Lookman's ball out from the back and running through on goal. He was denied by a superb last-ditch block from defender Kialonda Gaspar who deflected the ball away.

Masuaku's brilliant effort put the cherry on top of a convincing effort which came after four successive draws at the tournament in the Ivory Coast for the Congolese. They drew all three group games but still finished second behind Morocco in Group F and then after a 1-1 stalemate with Egypt, won on post-match penalties in the last 16 at the weekend.

103,Middlesbrough 1-1 Sunderland: Sub Nazariy Rusyn denies Boro derby-day victory,https://www.skysports.com/football/mboro-vs-sland/report/485054,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Substitute Nazariy Rusyn denied Middlesbrough derby-day victory as Sunderland hit back late to snatch a point at the Riverside Stadium. Boro looked to be heading for a Sky Bet Championship double over their neighbours courtesy of Marcus Forss' 61st-minute strike until Rusyn sent a dipping 83rd-minute shot past Tom Glover at his near post to snatch a 1-1 draw which leaves the Black Cats just a point shy of the play-off places. The Teessiders, who have a game in hand, remain three points worse off after allowing two to slip from their grasp on a day when Finn Azaz and Abdoullah Ba passed up glorious first-half chances for their respective sides. Azaz might have put Boro ahead with nine minutes gone after Sam Greenwood had raced clear of defender Dan Ballard on to Lukas Engel's long ball and forced a block from keeper Anthony Patterson, but he skied over from the rebound with the goal yawning. Boro keeper Glover saved from Jack Clarke and Trai Hume with the pace and trickery of Clarke and Ba keeping the Boro defence on its toes and the interplay between Jonny Howson, Hayden Hackney and Greenwood similarly occupying their opposite numbers. Hackney dragged a 29th-minute attempt after robbing Jobe Bellingham and Ba warmed Glover's hands with a rising drive two minutes later before firing wastefully into the side netting when he might have had better options in the middle. Sunderland should have been ahead five minutes before the break when Bellingham and Clarke mesmerised the home defence to seemingly present Ba with a tap-in at the far post, but Rav van den Berg somehow got across to block his effort on the line. How Middlesbrough and Sunderland lined up Match stats LIVE Championship table Stream Sky Sports with NOW Luke Ayling was denied by Hume after linking promisingly with Hackney and Forss down the right, and the Boro full-back curled another effort wide with the Teessiders dominating immediately after the restart. Patterson was fortunate to escape unpunished after dallying on a back-pass as Greenwood and Forss closed him down, but his luck ran out with 61 minutes gone. Dan Barlaser played a free-kick short to Hackney, who laid it off to Greenwood and his scuffed shot was controlled by Forss before he smashed the ball past the helpless keeper. Greenwood could have made it 2-0, but steered his shot across the face of goal with just Patterson to beat, and his side was made to pay when Rusyn squeezed his shot past Glover to level. Middlesbrough's Michael Carrick: ""There's frustration and there's a little bit of we need to get what we deserve from games and performances. It feels like we're losing points that we definitely should be gaining. ""I feel for the boys because they put a lot into the game and showed a lot of quality, especially second half to control it fully, and not to come away with the win is disappointing."" Sunderland's Michael Beale: ""Our reaction, I thought, was fantastic and we go and and score a goal and then after that, I thought that with one or two of the moments we had, certainly with [Jack] Clarke getting in down the left, that maybe we should do better again. ""But if you can't win... it's a big point, How big, we won't know for another few weeks yet."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."

The weight of anticipation weighed heavily on both sides heading into the game. Could Chelsea find consistency after a fine performance from midweek against Aston Villa? How would under-pressure Crystal Palace fare without three of their best players in Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise and Marc Guehi? The Eagles were by far the better in the first half. They outshot Chelsea six to one, and made it count too as Lerma volleyed home a sensational effort to see Crystal Palace ahead on the half-hour. But Chelsea improved after the break and it was another superb goal inside 90 seconds of the restart that saw them level, this time from former Crystal Palace loanee Gallagher. The game looked to be meandering towards a draw - but two late goals from Gallagher (90+1) and Fernandez (90+4) saw Chelsea to the three points. It sees Chelsea into the top 10 above Wolves with 34 points. Crystal Palace, meanwhile, remain five points above the relegation zone. It was Crystal Palace who had the better first-half chances. Djordje Petrovic saved from Jordan Ayew and Jean-Philippe Mateta - the latter's effort coming after a sloppy giveaway from the visitors. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! And the hosts made their chances count when Lerma scored a stunner. It was sloppy defending from Chelsea - and some industrious play from Tyrick Mitchell - that saw the ball break for the midfielder.

But, as three minutes of added time was shown, Gallagher dragged an effort wide and off target. And Gallagher thumped Chelsea level 90 seconds after a delayed restart - referee Michael Oliver needing to sort out some malfunctioning technology. One of Malo Gusto's right-wing crosses was finally met too as Gallagher thundered home the equaliser, roaring in celebration in front of the away fans to his right. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Although the second half remained a largely quiet affair, there were a few chances for either side. Ben Chilwell over the crossbar, while Nicolas Jackson also nodded wide. At the other end, Petrovic made a superb stop to deny Matheus Franca's fine effort. But for all of Crystal Palace's good work, they were sucker-punched in injury time. It was a neat check back from Cole Palmer for Gallagher, who then swept the ball into the bottom left corner for his second of the evening.

The Hammers suffered their joint-heaviest home defeat in league history - the only other time they have lost by six goals in the top flight came back in December 1963 against Blackburn Rovers (8-2). David Moyes' side were blown away during a 15-minute period towards the end of the first half in which the Gunners scored four goals. West Ham fans were seen leaving the stadium early in droves after William Saliba's headed opener was added to by a Bukayo Saka penalty and further finishes from Gabriel Magalhaes and Leandro Trossard. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking at half-time, Keane told Sky Sports: ""There are ways to lose a football match - West Ham have not turned up. ""They have not been physical, they are not tackling, no desire, no hunger, they look old and sluggish, they are not tracking back, no one has laid a glove on (Martin) Odegaard. ""Moyes must be fuming at half-time, but all credit to Arsenal, they look sharp and at it and have turned up.

West Ham the last 10 or 15 minutes have been an absolute disgrace."" It did not get any better for the hosts after the break as Saka added his second goal before Declan Rice crowned a virtuoso display on his second outing back on familiar territory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rice did not celebrate his stunning strike against his former club, but it was hugely satisfying after some sections of the West Ham fans booed him during Arsenal's Carabao Cup defeat at the London Stadium earlier in the season. This time around, however, Rice was applauded off the pitch moments later as those who stayed on both sides of the divide appreciated the quality of his display. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For only the second time in the Premier League, a side managed by Moyes conceded 6+ goals in a home game - both instances came in matches against Arsenal (also Everton 1-6 Arsenal in August 2009). There would be no consolation for the home spectators who stayed seated until the bitter end - and Keane was equally scathing after the final whistle. ""It was too easy,"" Keane added. ""West Ham looked shell-shocked. At some stage, your pride has to kick in. For Rice's goal, there were two or three players lining up to take the shot. West Ham really let their manager down today. ""For Arsenal, it's all positives off the back of last weekend. They've just had to keep that momentum going. To score six goals away from home is fantastic. ""We can criticise West Ham all we want but credit to Arsenal. They were efficient, they were strong. The way they won the game with their set-pieces and aerial threat. ""They could have scored a few more goals."" Sky Sports' Paul Merson: ""Defending wise, if that happened in Under-10s football you'd be going, 'seriously?!' ""Not getting tight, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor, I just think Arsenal made West Ham surrender and that is quite sad as a player as that is the one thing you do not want to do. ""There is ways of losing football matches, that is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today. They work hard and the one thing you do not get done at West Ham is by set-plays, and they were poor with them today. ""For Arsenal, it is just a massive result, it has done the goal difference the world of good - if this was Man City today who had won that game 6-0, we would be waxing lyrical. ""They have literally made West Ham surrender, they turned up, started well and carried it on and kept on going. ""A brilliant, brilliant result by Arsenal. They are now putting their chances away and working hard. If you want to win the Premier League, you have to bounce back [from defeats] as quickly as you can and they have done that. That is what Man City do and they have worked hard and been hard to beat. ""And fair play to them, they are right in this title race."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When West Ham beat Arsenal and Manchester United in December, there was talk of a Champions League challenge. They have lost to both in the past eight days, shipping nine goals in the process, and are still without a win in 2024. Alarm bells might not be ringing for Moyes just yet, but the sight of fans leaving at half-time told a sorry tale and the Scot cannot keep dining out on last season's Europa Conference League success forever. Moyes told Sky Sports: ""Yes, it certainly is [up there as one of the most disappointing days as manager of West Ham]. It's one of those days which you don't want to happen very often, and it happened today. ""It's not been like my teams in the past. I'll take a bit of time and look at it and see if I can fix it. I take the responsibility, I pick the team but the players have to take responsibility. ""It's really important we do those jobs really well. We will always try to be as well organised as we can be. Arsenal were very good - we mustn't take that away. We weren't good."" When the images of fans leaving the ground at half-time were put to him, Moyes added: ""I'm a football supporter... I understand that. I don't think the direction the club is heading in is the wrong direction. It's grown greatly since we came in. We were fighting relegation. We're not fighting relegation today. ""We were playing one of the top teams in the country who we took three points off earlier in the season so I have to say the club is in a really good place. We've had setbacks through the season and we'll try and come back from this one the best we can."" Player-of-the-match Saka told Sky Sports: ""We were 4-0 up in the first half and we could have scored more. We smelt blood today and went for the kill."" Martin Odegaard added: ""It was a brilliant performance. From start to end we dominated and controlled everything. Today, we were really sharp in front of goal. I'm proud of the team. Coming from a big game [against Liverpool] and a big win and backing it up today with a great performance. ""We are focusing on ourselves. We don't care too much about the other teams. We keep working hard. It's a good win but we move on."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This was Arsenal's joint-biggest win in a London derby in league competition, with all three of those ending 6-0. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta told Sky Sports: ""I'm extremely happy. The way we performed, the way we played. Such a big score in a really difficult place tells you a lot about how well the boys played today. ""It's great to make [club] history especially the way we have done it. We're in a good moment and when you have good moments you have to build and maintain the momentum. The team from the beginning looked really sharp. We had to put right the last two results against them and that was a good motivation for the boys. ""When you talk about consistency at his [Bukayo Saka] age...what he has done in the last two or three seasons is remarkable. His attitude, his quality, what he delivers every week...it's really difficult to find. That's why he is so important to us. ""It's always difficult to come back to your old club. The fans were really good to him [Declan Rice]. When he went to take the corner they clapped him so it's great to see that kind of reception. He loves this club so much and I know what it meant to him to play today. ""We have to share the goals. That desire and that commitment to get into the box to make things happen, it was excellent.""

Player of the match: Bukayo Saka The game was relatively even for the opening quarter of an hour but Arsenal soon seized the upper hand and set about inflicting merciless punishment as West Ham's capitulation began. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! The visitors had already created a string of chances before the opener, with Alphonse Areola brilliantly denying Trossard from the best of them, but Saliba's header caused the floodgates to open. Rice, booed on his return to his former side, was the creator-in-chief as his corner found Saliba at the far post. The midfielder then set up Arsenal's third from another dead-ball delivery as his diagonal free-kick was flicked in by the unmarked Gabriel. Either side of those two goals, there was the penalty won and converted by Saka as he put his costly miss in this fixture last season behind him having latched onto an excellent pass by Trossard and drawn contact from Areola. Saka's penalty sent West Ham fans streaming towards the exits and their numbers grew as the bombardment continued with Trossard adding the fourth, curling home a superb finish from Martin Odegaard's pass after more woeful defending. Moyes sought to stem the flow at half-time by throwing on Kalvin Phillips and Konstantinos Mavropanos for Kurt Zouma and Edson Alvarez but Arsenal picked up where they left off. Areola denied Saka with a quick reaction save as the pressure continued but he produced the fifth goal minutes later as he collected Odegaard's pass following patient build-up play, then cut inside and fired home clinically at the near post. At that point, it seemed implausible that West Ham's afternoon could get any worse but it did, and it was particularly painful that Rice was the man to compound their misery. It seemed Arsenal had missed the chance when a miscommunication between Odegaard and Trossard saw the ball run between them, but Rice was there to arc a wonderful, curling shot over Areola and into the net. The 25-year-old declined the opportunity to celebrate out of respect, despite being subjected to boos from the home fans earlier in the game, as he sealed a first win over his former side at the third attempt. Arteta had the luxury of bringing off Rice and Saka after that, with 16-year-old Ethan Nwaneri handed a late cameo for his second Premier League appearance. It was another positive in a statement win for Arsenal as the West Ham inquest began. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports: ""I'm extremely happy. The way we performed, the way we played. Such a big score in a really difficult place tells you a lot about how well the boys played today. ""It's great to make [club] history especially the way we have done it. We're in a good moment and we you have good moments you have to build and maintain the momentum. The team from the beginning looked really sharp. We had to put right the last two results against them and that was a good motivation for the boys."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On Bukayo Saka: ""When you talk about consistency at his age...what he has done in the last two or three seasons is remarkable. His attitude, his quality, what he delivers every week, it's really difficult to find. That's why he is so important to us."" On Declan Rice: ""It's always difficult to come back to your old club. The fans were really good to him. When he went to take the corner they clapped him so it's great to see that kind of reception. He loves this club so much and I know what it meant to him to play today. ""We have to share the goals. That desire and that commitment to get into the box to make things happen, it was excellent."" Having struggled to convert their dominance into goals for much of the season, Arsenal now cannot stop scoring. Their six-goal thrashing of West Ham made it 16 in their last four games. Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool were swatted aside. But this, their fourth consecutive win, was their most devastating display yet; their biggest away victory in Premier League history and another statement about their credentials. This is a serious team. Already the best in the league defensively, they have now found a level of cutting edge to match. The game at the London Stadium was just the latest reminder of their potency from set-pieces. But they were rampant from open play too. There is no out-and-out No 9 capable of rivalling Erling Haaland's scoring exploits, of course. But Arsenal are sharing the goals out. Against West Ham, there were five different scorers. They threatened from all angles. West Ham could not cope. Saka's double puts him on five goals from his last five Premier League games and he is not the only attacking player to have hit a rich vein of form at what feels like the right time. Trossard has three in his last four. Martinelli too. The fluidity of their front line was too much for West Ham, with Odegaard orchestrating proceedings and Kai Havertz constantly finding space to exploit. The fact they still have Gabriel Jesus to return from injury is another source of encouragement. Sky Sports' Roy Keane, speaking at half-time: ""There are ways to lose a football match - West Ham have not turned up, they have not been physical, they are not tackling, no desire, no hunger, they look old and sluggish, they are not tracking back, no one has laid a glove on Odegaard. ""Moyes must be fuming at half-time, but all credit to Arsenal, they look sharp and at it and have turned up. West Ham, though, a disgrace."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Paul Merson: ""Defending wise, if that happened in under-10s football you'd be going, 'seriously?!' ""Not getting tight, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor. I just think Arsenal made West Ham surrender and that is quite sad as a player as that is the one thing you do not want to do. ""There are ways of losing football matches. That is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today. ""They work hard and the one thing you do not get done at West Ham is by set-plays, and they were poor with them today."" West Ham boss David Moyes, speaking to Sky Sports: ""Yes, it certainly is [up there as one of the most disappointing days as manager of West Ham]. It's one of those days which you don't want to happen very often, and it happened today. ""It's not been like my teams in the past. I'll take a bit of time and look at it and see if I can fix it. I take the responsibility, I pick the team but the players have to take responsibility too. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's really important we do those jobs really well. We will always try to be as well organised as we can be. Arsenal were very good - we mustn't take that away. We weren't good. ""I'm a football supporter. I understand that [fans leaving early]. I don't think the direction the club is heading in is the wrong direction. It's grown greatly since we came in. We were fighting relegation. We're not fighting relegation today. ""We were playing one of the top teams in the country who we took three points off earlier in the season so I have to say the club is in a really good place. We've had setbacks through the season and we'll try and come back from this one the best we can.""

The two nations were drawn together in Group B2, following England's relegation from League A in September 2022. They will also face Finland and Greece during the initial stage of the tournament, which begins in September. Gareth Southgate's side last faced the Boys in Green in November 2020, when Harry Maguire, Jadon Sancho and Dominic Calvert-Lewin sealed a 3-0 friendly win behind closed doors at Wembley. Wales are also in League B, having been placed in Group B4 alongside Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey. It has been a decade since they faced Iceland and 13 years in September since they faced Montenegro. A 1-1 draw with Turkey in November, however, saw Rob Page's side miss out on automatic qualification for Euro 2024. Meanwhile, Scotland will play in League A for the first time, having topped Group B1 in 2022/23. Get Sky Sports on Whatsapp! Download the Sky Sports App Steve Clarke's side will face Croatia and Poland, as well as Portugal, who were the inaugural winners of the tournament back in 2019. In League C, Northern Ireland have been drawn against Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Belarus. The Green and White army last faced Bulgaria in 2022 World Cup qualifying in Sofia in October 2021, with a Todor Nedelev double cancelling out Conor Washington's opener. Their last victory over the nation came in 1979. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England manager Gareth Southgate believes the objective for his side is to win their group in order to go back into League A. Reacting to the draw, he told Sky Sports: ""There's some teams we haven't played for a while, there's going to be some difficult games for us. ""I think everybody in England will think it was a big disappointment to drop down to League B but you still have difficult games. ""Obviously our objective will be we have to try to win the group to get back up into League A."" He added: ""We've had varied experiences, the first time we finished third, the second two have been complicated for us, in all three versions we've used it to look at new players. ""Of course you have to balance looking at new players with winning games and we didn't manage to do that last time. ""The competition pairs the best with the best and my impressions of it have been really good. ""Unfortunately the second one reminds me of Covid and the third one we didn't play well and it was the build-up to a World Cup, so that was complicated for us."" Scotland boss Steve Clarke said his side had been drawn with ""three fantastic opponents"" in the Nations League's top tier. The Scots, at 36th, are five places below Poland in the FIFA rankings, while 2023 runners-up Croatia and Portugal are 10th and seventh respectively. Thursday's draw in Paris sets up Scotland potentially facing Luka Modric, Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski. ""It's our first time in League A so it was always going to be a difficult draw,"" said Clarke. ""We've got three fantastic opponents and hopefully six very good matches. I'm always a great believer, if you want to improve you have to play against the best teams. ""When you've been in football as long as I have, you don't make too many predictions. ""I predict tough matches but hopefully they will be tough matches for our opponents as well."" Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill hopes his squad can develop and reach the ""next level"" after being drawn alongside Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Belarus in the Nations League. Northern Ireland finished third in their group last time out, but O'Neill believes this year's competition can help his young squad grow. He said: ""I think they will be good games for the young squad that we have at the minute. It will be a test for them as part of their development as international players. ""We have to make sure that we develop as a team and try and get ourselves to the next level. I think everyone knows we've got a new team, a very young team. ""We have to develop this group of players going forward, we have to introduce some new players into the group as well, and the Nations League will give us more opportunity to do that ahead of the World Cup qualifiers next March.""

111,Premier League predictions: Brentford set to sting Liverpool's title bid,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13072043/premier-league-predictions-brentford-set-to-sting-liverpools-title-bid,Lewis Jones,Publish time not found,"Our tipster Jones Knows sprinkles his analysis and betting advice across an exciting Premier League weekend, tipping Liverpool to slip up at Brentford. Run away as fast as you can from the 4/7 with Sky Bet on a Liverpool away win. Brentford's direct, to the point style always causes issues for the big boys at home, especially Liverpool. The Bees have found the net six times against Jurgen Klopp's men in their two meetings at the Gtech, winning 3-1 and drawing 3-3. BTTS & over 2.5 goals in Brentford vs Liverpool, BTTS 'no' in Forest vs West Ham & Luton to win more corners than Man Utd! Liverpool may have only conceded 13 goals on the road - the second-best defensive record in the Premier League - but the underlying metrics point to an overachievement on that front. The chances they've shipped, using the expected goals against model, shows a result of 19.11 - an overperformance of six goals. That per 90 average of 1.59 expected goals against is only the fifth best in the Premier League - even Everton (1.54) sit above them on that front. A regression could be on the horizon, so Brentford are capable of scoring twice, especially with their main man Ivan Toney back and amongst the goals. Of course, it's hard to keep the Liverpool attack quiet too - they've scored three or more goals in 11 of their last 24 Premier League games. Goals look on the menu so backing both teams to score and over 2.5 goals around 4/5 with Sky Bet looks a winner in waiting. Burnley will be quaking in their boots at trying to stop the Arsenal set-piece machine. Vincent Kompany's men are a shambles from such situations, shipping 12 goals and a league-high 11.16 worth of expected goals. Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Get Sky Sports Meanwhile, Arsenal have scored a league-high 16 goals from set-pieces, including netting twice in the 3-1 win over Burnley from corners. My colleague Sam Blitz broke down Arsenal's set-piece prowess earlier this week - well worth a watch below. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Declan Rice has become a key part of Arsenal's strength from dead balls. Rice only took three corners in the first 20 Premier League games, but since then, he has taken 12 corners in four games and provided three assists from set-pieces, two of them coming against West Ham. His inswinging deliveries from the left are usually on point. Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford has been exposed by such tactics this season under the high ball so I'm firmly expecting Rice to provide opportunities for William Saliba, who scored in the corresponding fixture, and the bulldozing Gabriel, who has scored four times in the Premier League this season. Rice is 11/4 with Sky Bet for an assist whilst Saliba (9/1) and Gabriel (11/2) are both runners in the goalscorer markets. For a best bet though I'm looking to combine both angles and would advise taking the 11/1 on Rice providing an assist for either Saliba or Gabriel. Unai Emery is doing a magnificent job at Aston Villa. To get them firmly in the hunt for the Champions League considering some of the injuries they've been rocked with this season is worthy of praise. Boubacar Kamara is the latest long-term absentee now after suffering 'significant' knee damage against Manchester United, joining Ezri Konsa, Emi Buendia and Tyrone Mings in the treatment room, all of whom have knee injuries. Emery has shown he can find solutions when key players are missing, so I'm not overly worried for them at Fulham. One player that is fighting fit is John McGinn, who is set to start his 40th straight Premier League game. He remains a driving force in the Villa midfield, a position that does allow him to venture into some dangerous attacking positions. A haul of five goals - his best ever Premier League return - showcases the attack-minded role he's playing, as does his return of 11 shots on target in his last 10 Premier League games. Both the 9/2 with Sky Bet on him scoring and the 10/11 for him to have at least one shot on target are betting angles of note. Bruno Guimaraes has always struck me as a player that would relish playing further forward - and we got to see it in action at Nottingham Forest last weekend. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He's looked a little rash and unmotivated this season in his role playing at the base of Newcastle's three-man midfield but the switch to play him closer to the attackers and drop Lewis Miley into the holding role unleashed an exciting version of the Brazilian. He scored two fine goals at the City Ground, backing up his impressive performance towards the end of the 4-4 with Luton where he played with more freedom and registered an assist. He made 18 runs into the box across those two games, which is more than he's made in his last 14 games combined in the Premier League, highlighting his added attacking licence. All this equates to the 15/8 with Sky Bet available on Guimaraes either scoring or assisting a goal being a bet to keep on your radar. When a David Moyes team gets walloped, a reaction is almost guaranteed. You just know the preparation all week on the training ground for this trip will have been about defensive shape. Drill after drill. Drill after drill. Drill after drill. Those lads probably haven't seen a football for seven days. It's monotonous but it tends to work when assessing the evidence. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On the three previous occasions his West Ham side have conceded five or more goals in a game, the very next game has seen West Ham win without conceding a goal. For that trend to continue you can get 9/2 with Sky Bet on a Hammers away win to nil. Keeping along those lines, my eyes have been drawn to the 6/5 with Sky Bet on offer on 'no' in the both teams to score market which does seem generous when you factor in the likely ultra-defensive approach on show from West Ham. They won't allow Forest to unleash many counter-attacks. It's a bet that would have copped in nine of West Ham's last 13 fixtures. I think it'll go in again. Tottenham might be 1/2 with Sky Bet to secure a top four finish but I've still got trust issues with them. Just one clean sheet in their last 15 Premier League games isn't a great look and their overall defensive process when it comes to expected goals against (41.34) still has them ranked as the sixth worst in the league. Wolves are smart and streetwise enough to extend Tottenham's run without a clean sheet and I can't resist the 5/1 with Sky Bet on offer for Pedro Neto to score anytime. His ability to move with great electricity with the ball is bound to expose Spurs in wide areas and no Premier League player is averaging more shots from fast breaks per 90 than Neto this season (0.65). In his last five game since returning from injury he's posted 12 shots, six of them on target and scored two goals. With Matheus Cunha out, he'll be tasked with the responsibility of leading the Wolves charge in forward areas and chances should fall his way against this type of opponent. Just let this sink in: Chelsea made 420 passes in the first half against Crystal Palace and managed to register just one shot. It was the poorest passes-to-shots ratio in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta started collating data in 2003. They improved their tempo after the break but it still took two injury-time goals to beat a Palace side without their four most influential players. This strange, disjointed Chelsea team could be in for another rude awakening - like they suffered at Liverpool. Everton showed how you restrict City, by defending as a unit showing exemplary and rigorous organisation. And they lost 2-0 despite almost being almost perfect defensively. Chelsea don't possess the defensive unity to survive any sort of onslaught as shown by conceding four goals to Wolves, Newcastle, Liverpool and City in the reverse fixture this season. Finding a way to boost the 1/3 with Sky Bet for a home win looks the play so adding City to be winning at half-time and full-time is how to get there at 10/11. In the last six seasons from February onwards, City have been winning at half-time in 69 per cent of their home fixtures meaning there's an edge in that 10/11 price. Sheffield United have conceded 10 goals in their last two home games - five of those to Brighton in the FA Cup. They have conceded goals at an unparalleled rate this season - their record currently stands at 60 conceded, the most by any team at this stage of a Premier League season. That average of 2.5 goals conceded per game means they are on course to concede 95 goals this season which would be a new Premier League record in a 38-game season. But here's the plot twist: I'm keen on them to get a result here at 11/8 with Sky Bet. Brighton, who have kept just two clean sheets in the Premier League this season, are just too short. It's now just four wins from their last 18 Premier League games and they've won just one of their last six Premier League games against teams starting the day in the relegation places, conceding 15 goals. There the 1-1 with the Blades amongst that run, too. This isn't the Brighton of last season where their attacking output was up there with Manchester City's - it's dropped like a stone and their defensive process is taking a hit too. Even in that 5-2 win over the Blades in the FA Cup, Brighton lost the non-penalty expected goals count 1.02 vs 2.28. I wouldn't put you off the upset. It's very difficult to back against Manchester United in these types of matches when you consider their near-perfect record away from home against teams that finished in the bottom 11 places of the Premier League last season or are predicted to be there this season. Since the start of last season, they have taken 40 points from 48 available against such opposition and conceded just eight goals in those 16 matches. It's rarely pretty on the eye or convincing, though, meaning Luton are fancied to cause United problems with their unique style. We can profit from this by heading to the corner markets. Rob Edwards' team look a fantastic bet to win more corners than United at a juicy 11/8 with Sky Bet. Regular readers will know all about how the Luton corner lines have spiked recently to the extent that they've won more corners than the opposition in seven of their last eight matches across all competitions. The aggregate corner count over those fixtures reads Luton 64-29 Opposition. A pummelling. United's low corner count in away fixtures against bottom-half teams also offers further confidence behind a Luton corner win. In their last 15 matches against bottom-half teams on the road, United have won just four of the corner counts with the aggregate score reading Man Utd 64-88 Opposition. They've also only won six or more corners in just two of those 15 fixtures. The lines look all wrong, so there's huge value to be had backing Luton to win the corner count. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  At the time of writing, there's so many unknowns regarding Crystal Palace's team news and managerial situation. That makes putting together a sensible and measured prediction almost impossible. If the likes of Marc Guehi, Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze are all out and the manager situation remains up in the air, Everton should be taking advantage at 7/10 with Sky Bet for the home win but if an announcement comes that ex-Eintracht Frankfurt boss Oliver Glasner taking over, as reported by Sky in Germany, then it changes everything.

112,"Bristol City 3-1 Southampton: Sam Bell, Rob Dickie and Harry Cornick score as Saints' 25-game unbeaten run ends",https://www.skysports.com/football/bristol-c-vs-soton/report/485075,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Second-half goals from Sam Bell, Rob Dickie and Harry Cornick put a dent in Southampton's bid for automatic promotion as Bristol City won an entertaining Championship clash 3-1 at Ashton Gate. The home side grabbed a 52nd-minute lead when Anis Mehmeti and Jason Knight exchanged passes on the right of the box and Mehmeti crossed low for Bell to net from six yards. Centre-back Dickie rose above the Saints defence to head home a Joe Williams corner from the left after 72 minutes and Cornick set the seal on an impressive City display by lashing home an 82nd-minute cross from fellow substitute Ross McCrorie. Southampton had to wait until stoppage time to reply when Adam Armstrong netted from the spot following a foul on Kyle Walker-Peters. The visitors could have no complaints after failing to find a finish to match some slick passing moves. It was Liam Manning's best win since replacing Nigel Pearson as City boss. His side edged an open first half in which both teams produced some attractive football without conjuring up a telling final touch. Manning's team were quicker off the blocks and the first seven minutes saw Bell, Tommy Conway and George Tanner have attempts on goal without troubling goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports It was Southampton who came closest to breaking the deadlock after 18 minutes when a looping volley from Samuel Edozie clipped the crossbar. Knight sent a low volley wide for the hosts before City goalkeeper Max O'Leary had to save bravely at the feet of Will Smallbone. Walker-Peters and David Brooks were combining well on Southampton's right flank, but the Saints defence looked vulnerable as Mehmeti had a shot saved and Bell fired inches wide at the far post from a right wing cross. City defender Zak Vyner had to block two shots from Armstrong, who also forced a save from O'Leary. At the other end Bazunu did well to race outside his box to rob Mehmeti as he broke on to a clever Knight pass, before the half ended with a Mehmeti shot deflected into the side-netting. Saints looked sure to go ahead a minute into the second half when Edozie sent a low left-footed drive across goal and Brooks just failed to get a touch as he slid in, colliding with a post and requiring treatment. It proved a key moment. Russell Martin had sent on Stuart Armstrong in place of Shea Charles. But it was City who struck with Bell's close-range finish to take a deserved lead. From then on, Manning's men dominated with some fast attacking football. The goals from Dickie and Cornick rammed home their superiority. Other chances went begging, but Ashton Gate was rocking at the final whistle as home fans contemplated a late play-off challenge. Bristol City's Liam Manning: ""It was the most complete performance since I took the job. Our levels have been good and consistent, but not always showing the ruthlessness we need. ""That was still the case in the first half tonight and Southampton got on top of us for 20 minutes or so. ""Apart from that, I couldn't have asked for more. I'm really pleased for Sam Bell that he scored. ""I had a chat with him the day after he missed his shoot-out penalty at Nottingham Forest last week and his response to that disappointment in the FA Cup has been fantastic. ""It says a lot for the spirit in our camp that we have bounced back to win two tough Championship games.

113,VAR: Premier League claims 96 per cent of referee decisions are correct - so what is future of technology in football?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13066177/var-premier-league-claims-96-per-cent-of-referee-decisions-are-correct-so-what-is-future-of-technology-in-football,Rob Dorsett,Publish time not found,"The Premier League has admitted there have been 20 wrong VAR decisions this season but insists, according to a new survey, the ""majority"" of supporters are in favour of the technology – which they claim has led to a 14 per cent increase in correct decisions. The details of that survey, conducted by the Premier League themselves, have not been made public, but Tony Scholes, the Premier League's chief football officer, sat down with senior reporter Rob Dorsett to discuss VAR's performance this season and plans to improve technology. The latest Premier League statistics show before VAR was introduced, 82 per cent of refereeing decisions were correct. Now, since VAR was introduced, 96 per cent of decisions are correct. ""VAR is, and remains, a very effective tool in supporting the match officials on the pitch,"" Scholes says. Two years ago, the Premier League set up an independent key match incidents panel (KMI panel), which assesses all the big decisions made by referees in every Premier League game. The panel is made up of former players, former coaches and referees, who report their opinions so the Premier League and the Professional Match Game Officials Limited (PGMOL) can improve standards. ""The purpose of that panel is to analyse and take a view on every key decision made by the match officials in every single one of the 380 games,"" Scholes explains. Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App ""The output of that analysis is used to help coach the referees, to help give PGMOL management a view as to where the game, as represented by these former players and coaches, doesn't agree with the approach that the referees are taking."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Scholes is adamant the panel's conclusions, having reviewed all of the refereeing decisions in the top division, proves VAR has improved decision-making since it was introduced for the 2019/20 season. This season, the KMI panel has decided: We asked you for your thoughts on the biggest changes VAR needs - here's what you had to say...

Roger: Drop the ‘clear and obvious’ tag and replace with rugby union’s ‘is there any reason why I can’t allow this try/goal?’

Jboi6!:  If the ref doesn’t deem it a serious error then it shouldn’t go to VAR. Also if someone’s shoelace is offside it shouldn’t be a problem - It wasn’t five years ago.

Shaun: VAR needs to be consistent, after this season they need to drastically improve decision making involving VAR or scrap it completely. I’ve preferred watching the FA cup games without VAR, it's back to real football.

Matt L: I’d change it to a ‘challenge’ system. Both teams have 2 challenges and can use 1 per half. They challenge a call that wasn’t given and VAR check it, like tennis. Yes. Scholes says there are two major issues he wants to see addressed with VAR going forward. ""These two elements, I believe, affect the whole reputation of VAR. The first is the amount of time it is taking to check decisions. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We are doing too many checks, we're taking too long in doing them as well. It's to a degree understandable, given the level of scrutiny these guys are under. But the reviews are taking too long and it's affecting the flow of the game and we're extremely aware of that and the need to improve that speed while always maintaining the accuracy."" The second area is the ""in-stadium experience"" for supporters, which Scholes says simply is not good enough. ""It's nowhere near good enough. We know it's not. It affects supporters' enjoyment of the game and we know it needs to change."" But Scholes goes on to say the Premier League's major frustration is that it is powerless to change this. ""We're constrained by IFAB at the moment,"" he laments. ""IFAB are very clear on their rules as to what we can and can't say, both during the VAR process and post the VAR process. We cannot play the audio. ""My personal view is we're on a journey and that we'll get to a point where both the video and the audio is played live and then played again afterwards to explain the decision. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""How far we are away from that, I don't know. That's not in our hands. That's decided by IFAB. But we will continue to lobby them to get to a place where VAR is as open, transparent and informative to supporters and all stakeholders as it is possible to do."" Scholes has revealed for the first time both the Premier League and PGMOL have begun a new project, aimed at identifying future specialist VARs already working as referees further down the football pyramid. ""PGMOL is identifying referees, who are perhaps operating in the EFL or the National League, who they believe have got the attributes required in order to be a good VAR. ""Those people who are then selected will go through a training programme with the intention of developing a group of specialist VARs to supplement, not replace, those members of the select group who at the moment operate very effectively as VARs, as well as on the pitch."" Scholes says there are plans to introduce it, but it may not be in place for the start of next season. At the moment, two separate systems are being trialled, but he says there are technical concerns with both. When a number of players are between the cameras and the ball, there have been some decisions where it has been hard to identify whether a specific body part is that of an attacker or a defender. Scholes says until those concerns are completely eradicated, the Premier League will not consider introducing it. ""It's what we call the edge cases. So those cases where many things are occurring at once, you might have a lot of bodies in one place, and it's the ability of the system to identify different parts of the body. ""For the vast majority of cases, there won't be an issue. But we want to be clear in our competition before we introduce anything that will give us unintended or unanticipated problems in other areas."" Scholes says if those problems can be ironed out, semi-automated offside technology may be put to clubs to vote on later this year.

119,Hibs 1-2 Celtic: Adam Idah's late penalty restores champions' three-point lead in Scottish Premiership title race,https://www.skysports.com/football/hibernian-vs-celtic/report/487735,Alison Conroy,Publish time not found,"Adam Idah's penalty double saw Celtic survive a scare at Hibs as a late 2-1 win restored their three-point lead in the Scottish Premiership title race. The on-loan striker opened his account from the spot early on in the first half as Alistair Johnston was carried off after Nectarios Trianis' foul in the box. The Hoops lacked quality in the final third as they looked to respond from dropping points in their last game at Aberdeen and Dylan Levitt's stunning strike pulled the hosts level in the second half. With the game heading for a draw, Joe Newell's clumsy challenge on Celtic substitute Kyogo Furuhashi allowed Idah to confidently step up to dispatch his second penalty of the game. Brendan Rodgers' first win at Easter Road was a blow to Hibs, who are without a win in the Scottish Premiership since December 9. Hibs sat deep in the opening moments, but their attempts to frustrate Celtic came unstuck when Triantis was late on Johnston in an aerial challenge. Referee Nick Walsh pointed to the spot before the Canada international was carried off on a stretcher after about five minutes of treatment. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Anthony Ralston came on before Idah sent David Marshall the wrong way from the spot. Hibs remained disciplined in their shape and they had a good chance midway through the half when Jordan Obita's cross caused difficulties for Celtic, with both Joe Hart and Alexandro Bernabei unable to deal with it. The ball broke invitingly for Elie Youan eight yards out but the wide player shot well over, although Walsh gave a corner after Liam Scales threw himself in front of the effort. Hibernian lined up with a 4-5-1 formation, with Lewis Miller and Martin Boyle also back from the Asian Cup. Nicolas Kuhn also made his first Celtic start in a new-look front three that featured Daizen Maeda following his return from the Qatar tournament, while Stephen Welsh replaced Maik Nawrocki in central defence. Idah missed chances either side of the break but was flagged offside each time before being played in again by Matt O'Riley and being foiled by a good save from Marshall. Hibs levelled after Newell's free-kick was headed back to Levitt by Will Fish. The Wales midfielder showed excellent technique to guide his strike into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The home fans suddenly found their voice and Hart parried Myziane Maolida's overhead kick before Boyle went flying in the box as he took on Bernabei. The winger was booked for diving. The Celtic defence looked vulnerable and Rodgers brought on Maik Nawrocki for Stephen Welsh. Ralston made two important blocks as Hibs continued to press before Rodgers brought on Kyogo Furuhashi in the 71st minute. Celtic had a better spell but both Idah and Kyogo failed to get shots away after Bernabei's cross ultimately set both of them up for good chances. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Miller missed a glorious chance for Hibs when he sent Newell's deep cross beyond the far post and Fish then turned on the edge of the box and shot just wide.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Hibs head coach Nick Montgomery was left frustrated by some decisions: ""I thought we probably deserved to win the game. ""I've seen some of the incidents and I'm just really disappointed. ""For the first penalty, they've both gone to win the header and if that happens anywhere else on the pitch, he stops the game and possibly just gets treatment for the players and maybe it's a drop ball. ""The second one, I don't think anyone including the Celtic players thought it was a penalty then he goes to VAR. ""I have seen Martin Boyle's penalty [claim] and I think if someone calls him over to look at that, there's contact. He's come from behind and he's caught him on his thigh. ""It doesn't matter how he's fallen down, if he goes over to look at that on the monitor it's a penalty. ""That's probably the one I'm most disappointed with.

121,Watford 0-1 Cardiff City: Josh Bowler scores as Bluebirds beat Hornets,https://www.skysports.com/football/watford-vs-cardiff/report/485060,Author not found,Publish time not found,"A stunning Josh Bowler strike two minutes before half-time gave Cardiff a 1-0 victory over Watford at Vicarage Road. Bowler held off one Watford player, cut inside another and sent a delightful curler beyond the outstretched hand of Ben Hamer and into the far corner. The result means that in the past 14 meetings between these teams, only two have been won by the home side. While Erol Bulut's Cardiff looked assured throughout, Watford are beginning to look like a team lacking the attacking flair to force their way into the Championship play-off positions. The match gathered momentum as the first half progressed. After a quiet opening 20 minutes, 19-year-old full-back Ryan Andrews almost sliced the perfect pass through the Cardiff defence only for Vakoun Bayo to be squeezed out of room. At the other end, Bowler thudded a shot into the advertising hoardings in what was effectively a sighter for his fine strike later in the half. Andrews then brought a full-length save out of Cardiff goalkeeper Jak Alnwick before Watford's patient approach almost earned its reward in the 27th minute. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports Ismael Kone sent in a diagonal cross which was headed back across the area by Jamal Lewis for Yaser Asprilla to force Alnwick into a save with his legs. The impressive Andrews then took it upon himself to try and give his side the lead six minutes before the interval, opening up his body to attempt a driven lob over Alnwick, which the keeper managed to tip over the bar. The opening goal arrived three minutes later with Bowler's superb effort. Cardiff had been largely passive in the first period, but they began the second forcing Watford back as they searched for a second goal. Rubin Colwill was always ready to run at defenders, with one forcing a free-kick from which Perry Ng curled narrowly wide. Watford, by contrast, had lost any first-half impetus. That was until a Lewis cross just before the hour was steered against the outside of the post by Kone. Sensing the moment, Watford manager Valerien Ismael made a triple substitution and pressure increased on the Cardiff goal in the final half-hour. Asprilla and substitute Emmanuel Dennis shot over the crossbar, Wesley Hoedt saw an effort deflected into the side netting while Tom Dele-Bashiru was denied by a flying Alnwick save. A succession of goalmouth scrambles preceded the final whistle which was greeted by a chorus of boos from home supporters as Cardiff held on. Watford's Valerien Ismael: ""There's a big frustration tonight. I have the feeling that over 90 minutes, we should win the game. Yes, our opponents were disciplined, but they had one shot on target and scored the goal. ""It's painful to lose at home again because we want to give something to our fans. This is a setback for us because we need to use the home games to be strong. So today for me is a tough one to take. ""We said to the players at half-time. 'You need to step up and believe in yourselves because I believe in you and we believe in you'. ""After the substitutions it was much better. We dominated the ball and we created chances, but in the final third it's more about desire. ""We need to be nasty in the opponents' box to get in front of defenders, to make sure you are always there."" Cardiff's Erol Bulut: ""After a few weeks of not winning points we were disappointed, so the three days off that we gave the players refreshed our team. ""Everybody came back with a clear mind and an analysis about themselves and about what they need to do to play much better. ""I think the whole team did really good work today.

122,Motherwell 5-0 Ross County: Theo Bair continues scoring run as Stuart Kettlewell's side ease relegation fears,https://www.skysports.com/football/motherwell-vs-ross-co/report/487737,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Theo Bair scored for a fifth consecutive cinch Premiership game as Motherwell thrashed Ross County 5-0 at Fir Park. The former St Johnstone forward put Motherwell three up with a 38th-minute penalty to make it six goals during his run and eight for the season. Blair Spittal struck two brilliantly-taken goals and both Andy Halliday and Jack Vale hit their first Motherwell goals as the Steelmen recorded their biggest victory since beating the same opponents by the same scoreline under Steven Hammell in October 2022. Despite claiming only a second win in 20 league games, Stuart Kettlewell's side moved one point off the top six and opened up a six-point lead over second-bottom County. Derek Adams' side have not won since beating Motherwell two months ago and have only collected two points in that period. Bair could easily have had a hat-trick as Motherwell took advantage of an open County structure which left their two centre-backs exposed. Motherwell were ahead in the eighth minute when Spittal fed Bair to square for Halliday to sweep home from 12 yards. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app The home side doubled their lead in the 21st minute when Spittal latched on to Halliday's pass and curled a powerful shot in off the far post from the left corner of the box. It initially looked like being a frustrating night for Bair, who was twice set up for one-on-ones by Spittal but was foiled by George Wickens each time. The striker could not quite reach Spittal's low cross and was then waiting for a tap-in when Harry Paton picked the wrong option. Bair came closer when he chested down Stephen O'Donnell's diagonal ball and volleyed into the top corner from 18 yards, only to be denied by the offside flag. But the Canada international got his goal after Paton was tripped by Will Nightingale, assuming penalty duties from Spittal, who missed his last effort against Alloa. Bair shrugged off a needlessly-lengthy VAR delay to send Wickens the wrong way. County had plenty of possession in the first half but Motherwell generally blocked their way to goal with some compact defending and effective pressing. Liam Kelly comfortably saved from Simon Murray in the visitors' only effort on target before the break. Motherwell looked comfortable after the restart without seriously threatening and Murray missed a glorious chance to give the visitors a lifeline midway through the second half when he sent a free header wide from six yards out. The hosts otherwise looked the far more dangerous side. Bair was again played through by Spittal and appeared to have done everything right when he dinked the ball over Wickens but his effort drifted just wide. Wickens saved well from Georgie Gent after slack play from James Brown but the goalkeeper was well beaten in the 87th minute when Spittal curled a majestic strike into the top corner from 25 yards. The midfielder then played a perfect pass in between the County central defence for on-loan Blackburn forward Vale to run on to and slot home in stoppage-time. Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell said: ""It's a top-drawer performance. To beat any team in this league 5-0, you're playing well.

123,Rangers 3-1 Ross County: Philippe Clement's side miss chance to move top of Scottish Premiership,https://www.skysports.com/football/rangers-vs-ross-co/report/487709,Alison Conroy,Publish time not found,"Rangers moved level on points with Celtic but failed to finish enough of their countless shots on target to move top of the Scottish Premiership. Philippe Clement's side had to beat County by at least three goals to move above Celtic for the first time this season and Cyriel Dessers' early strike gave them hope. Simon Murray caught out the Rangers' defence to claim a surprise equaliser before Dessers' deflected header saw the hosts ahead at the break. Rangers were wasteful, while County goalkeeper George Wickens produced a string of saves to keep Clement's side at bay until John Souttar nodded home a third in injury time. Victory keeps the pressure on champions Celtic, while Ross County are 11th. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Another huge crowd rolled up to Ibrox knowing a three-goal win against a club who had never beaten Rangers in 23 attempts would see the lead at the top change hands. A sense of expectancy hung heavy in the air. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Dessers struck early, taking a pass from captain James Tavernier and fending off the attention of defender Ryan Leak before lobbing the ball over stranded Staggies 'keeper Wickens and the Light Blues were up and running. Philippe Clement made seven changes from Saturday's 2-0 Scottish Cup win over Ayr United.

Ridvan Yilmaz, John Lundstram, Tom Lawrence, Ross McCausland, Todd Cantwell, Rabbi Matondo and Cyriel Dessers all returned. Ross County's interim manager Don Cowie brought in Eamonn Brophy, Michee Efete, Ryan Leak, Josh Reid and Victor Loturi. Wickens soon had to tip a powerful shot from Tavernier past the post for a corner, which the startled Dingwall side survived. In the 10th minute, Dessers latched on to a raking pass from left-back Rıdvan Yilmaz and beat Wickens only to see the ball rebound off the post. Then Rabbi Matondo raced onto a defence-splitting pass from midfielder Lundstram and curled the ball past the far post before Wickens tipped a shot from the wide man onto the bar and over. Tom Lawrence, Souttar, Tavernier and Dessers had further efforts of various quality before Murray stunned the home fans into silence with a confident volley from six yards from a delicious Eamonn Brophy cross. The mood inside the stadium darkened. The Gers crowd looked on in astonishment as Leak stopped Dessers' close-range shot after Wickens had spilled a Todd Cantwell drive but the enigmatic striker made up for it by heading in a Tavernier cross seconds before the break which changed the atmosphere again. January signing Oscar Cortes, the 20-year-old Colombian signed on loan from Lens, replaced Matondo at half-time and in the 52nd minute had a decent drive parried clear by the over-worked Wickens, who soon tipped a long-range effort from Cantwell past the post. The pressure on the County goal was relentless but just after the hour-mark, the Gers fans were relieved to see Michee Efete head a County corner over the bar when he should have worked 'keeper Jack Butland. Wickens made further saves from Lundstram, Lawrence and Dessers before the latter was replaced by Portuguese striker Fabio Silva. In the 74th minute Cortes missed the target from 12 yards and, amid a myriad of attempts on the County goal, Wickens denied Cantwell and Cortes again. In the second of seven added minutes, Souttar headed in a Tavernier cross but there was to be no later drama and the chance to strike a psychological blow was gone.

125,Aston Villa 1-3 Chelsea: Enzo Fernandez hits stunner as Blues reach FA Cup fifth round,https://www.skysports.com/football/a-villa-vs-chelsea/report/503121,Charlotte Marsh,Publish time not found,"Mauricio Pochettino says Chelsea are not the same team they were 20 years ago and people must ""move on"" after he lauded ""one of the best"" performances of the season in their 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round replay win at Aston Villa. The victory at Villa Park on Wednesday night set up a home tie against Leeds in the fifth round in the week commencing February 26. After scoring a stunning free-kick, Enzo Fernandez took off his match shirt and displayed his name and number to the crowd. The reasoning is unclear, but the game overall marked a clear improvement from Chelsea And in his post-match press conference, Blues boss Pochettino launched a staunch defence of his players after he was questioned about Fernandez's goal celebration. He said: ""We need to stop this thing that we are Chelsea from 20 years ago. We are not this type of Chelsea anymore. Now we need to move on and we need to create this project. ""We need to move on, I don't care if people are happy or not happy with my speech. I care for the club, I care for my players, I want to help the players. ""We are going to fight, I don't care what the people say. I'm not more sad or happy today after a win because we have experience, this type of project needs time and trust.

""We cannot build a team to challenge because you need to fix too many things, you need to observe, analyse and compete. ""We are building a project which may be one year, two years, three years. Today you can see we were ready to fight. We fight for the fans, the badge, the coaching staff. Now the challenge is to be consistent."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The replay was a game that flipped performance and form on its head. Aston Villa had thrashed Sheffield United at the weekend, while Chelsea had conceded four goals in each of their last two matches. But the Blues dominated the first half against a lacklustre Villa, with Conor Gallagher (11) - scoring his first goal of the season - and Nicolas Jackson (21) seeing them into a 2-0 lead. Fernandez's stunning 54th-minute free-kick was the pick of the goals though. Moussa Diaby's stoppage-time consolation made things nervy for the visitors, but Aston Villa were unable to complete an unlikely comeback. When asked by ITV Sport if it was one of Chelsea's best performances of the season, Pochettino replied: ""I think so... it is one of the best or maybe the best of the season. ""It is a very good moment for us and I'm so happy with performance. The players were enjoying their football and that is what pleased me the most."" Despite a positive opening from Aston Villa, it was Chelsea who dominated the encounter and went ahead inside 11 minutes. Jackson found the impressive Noni Madueke in the middle with his left-wing cross, with the latter pulling it back to Gallagher. It was then a delightful, curling effort from the midfielder into the top left corner. Chelsea soon took a commanding 2-0 lead. Malo Gusto sent in a peach of a delivery for the waiting Jackson, who was unmarked as he nodded home past Emi Martinez. Aston Villa's best chance came on the stroke of half-time. A Ben Chilwell foul throw gifted the hosts their own, which they took quickly. However, the opening came to nothing as John McGinn lashed an effort into the stands. Ten minutes into the second half, Fernandez added Chelsea's third with a stunning free-kick. He won it after he was fouled by Youri Tielemans just outside the area, and curled a world-class effort through Martinez's outstretched hands. Aston Villa's performance did improve from then on - although it was a bit too little, too late. McGinn had a few openings, while Alex Moreno nodded wide, but they did score a late consolation through Diaby. His shot through the area fizzed through legs before nestling into the net via the goalpost. But despite the nervy ending, it was not enough to force extra-time as Aston Villa exited the FA Cup. Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell to ITV Sport: ""It was exactly the reaction we wanted and needed. It wasn't about wanting a reaction. We needed it. Fair play to all of the boys. ""We wanted that pressure. We thrived off it. The confidence before the game in the changing room was the best I have seen it - the togetherness. We delivered on the pitch today. ""As a club, the players, manager, the staff, the fans everyone involved in the club. It wasn't just the manager. Everyone associated with the club needed that today."" Aston Villa manager Unai Emery: ""We were excited and motivated and we started well, we didn't score but we were feeling good. ""When they were getting in our box we were not being strong and they were affecting us. They got into our box with some crosses and were clinical. I was more or less feeling the difference was the clinical way for them. ""We scored a little bit late and had no time to score the second goal. We have to accept and analyse the match.

128,Rotherham United 0-2 Southampton: Saints march up to second with victory,https://www.skysports.com/football/rotherham-vs-soton/report/485057,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Southampton climbed into the top two in the Championship after continuing their impressive form by sweeping aside struggling Rotherham 2-0. The high-flying Saints made it 23 games unbeaten with a dominant display at the AESSEAL New York Stadium where first-half goals from Jan Bednarek and Adam Armstrong did the damage. Victory sees Southampton up to second behind Leicester while rock-bottom Rotherham are now a massive 12 points from safety at the foot of the table, and with just one win in 17 league games. It took the visitors just four minutes to go in front with Bednarek reacting quickest in the box to head beyond Viktor Johansson. Rotherham responded quite well to the early setback and carved out a decent opportunity when Peter Kioso crossed for Jordan Hugill to fire just over. The visitors were just inches off doubling their advantage when Ryan Fraser took aim from 25 yards, only for his effort to cannon off the post. Intricate play around the box then led to a great chance for Stuart Armstrong but he was denied by the sharpness of Johansson. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports There was nothing the Sweden international goalkeeper could do about Southampton's second goal though, which arrived in the 38th minute. It came from a lightning move with Fraser putting through by a chipped ball from Taylor Harwood-Bellis. Fraser then had the awareness to cleverly backheel the ball to Adam Armstrong who tucked his shot into the bottom corner. It was almost 3-0 moments later with Will Smallbone denied by a strong hand from Johansson. Gavin Bazunu was called into action at the other end with Seb Revan unleashing an effort after showing skill down the left. The hosts threatened again early in the second half as they sought a way back into the game, Sam Clucas trying another spectacular volley to match his goal of the month contender in January, but this time it drifted off target. Adam Armstrong had a sniff of a chance when he was picked out by a clever ball from Smallbone but his heavy first touch allowed Johansson to deny him. Rotherham were doing the bulk of the pushing in the second half with the visitors content to sit on their lead. The Millers had a good chance to get one back but Kioso could not pick out substitute Sam Nombe, who had made a good run to the front post. Southampton brought on January capture David Brooks in the 74th minute and he almost made an instant impact only to see his effort, after cutting in from the right flank, whistle over the bar. Rotherham came close to an injury-time consolation as Ollie Rathbone caught a volley perfectly, but Bazunu was equal to it to ensure a clean sheet. Rotherham's Leam Richardson: ""Southampton were exactly what we expected. They're a team full of quality and going very well. We knew the challenges we were going to face. ""The only disappointing thing is the way we started the game. Second half was more like us without creating massive chances. ""They could control the game a little bit more. It was a tough afternoon for the boys. ""We either feel sorry for ourselves and don't do anything about it or we meet the challenges. ""We should never be OK with losing 2-0 to Southampton because we want a competitive environment. ""You either meet the challenge head on or you back off. I would rather go and be pro-active. If you're going to lose, lose being the best version of yourself. ""The challenge was to go and win the second half and we possibly could have done."" Southampton's Russell Martin: ""I really enjoyed the performance and the control we had. ""Their goalie made some really good saves and we should have scored a couple more goals. We limited them to very little. ""They really looked after each other. They fought so hard and ran so hard out of possession - especially from direct balls and long throws. It was really tough to play against. ""I am really proud of the players. It was a tough pitch compared to what the guys play on. The players said it was the toughest they have played on all season. ""We had a joke at breakfast about going 20-odd unbeaten and still being fourth. That's the level of the competition, it's outstanding and it's great to be involved in. The lads are just head on and enjoying the opportunity. ""The players keep showing the humility and hunger. Hopefully we can keep enjoying this feeling for as long as possible.

The findings reveal Erik ten Hag's squad cost a staggering £1.2bn in transfer fees last term, when this side secured a third-place finish in the Premier League, won the Carabao Cup and finished runners-up in the FA Cup. However, United have struggled this season, crashing out of the Champions League and currently sitting sixth in the Premier League table after a recent upturn in form. The record-breaking figure includes huge fees splashed out on Antony (£86m), Harry Maguire (£80m), Jadon Sancho (£73m) and Casemiro (£70m) - but excludes several expensive acquisitions signed last summer, who arrived after the 2022/23 financial year.

In terms of Chelsea, that total is likely to explode for 2022/23 given the Blues have spent £1bn on new signings since it was calculated, having undertaken a record-breaking transfer splurge after Todd Boehly bought the club. Liverpool (£774.1m) rank sixth in the table, with fellow Premier League sides Arsenal (seventh with £761.3m), Tottenham (ninth with £569.7m), Newcastle (12th with £464.5m), Aston Villa (15th with £427.7m) and West Ham (17th with £378.9m) among the top 20.

Last month Eriksson revealed he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and has around a year at most to live. Following his announcement, the 75-year-old admitted he was a Reds fan and had ""always wished to be the manager of Liverpool"" leading to a campaign for the Swede to take charge of a Liverpool Legends' game.

Eriksson will be part of a management team including Liverpool greats Ian Rush, John Barnes and John Aldridge for the annual LFC Foundation charity match.

134,Gary O’Neil’s Wolves: Improving Pedro Neto and Matheus Cunha to transform Premier League’s lowest scorers,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11699/13065238/gary-oneils-wolves-improving-pedro-neto-and-matheus-cunha-to-transform-premier-leagues-lowest-scorers,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"When Wolves beat Brentford 4-1 just after Christmas, it was the first time that the club had won an away game by scoring four goals in Premier League history. Just five weeks later, against Chelsea, Gary O’Neil’s team managed to do it again. The 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge will be framed in the context of a Chelsea crisis but there is another side to the story. Wolves, the Premier League's lowest scorers last season, are on course for their best goals-per-game record in the top division for 60 years. Stan Cullis was the manager then. There is a statue of him at Molineux outside the stand that bears his name, honouring the man who took Wolves to three titles. Few expected much to celebrate this season let alone statistics harking back to the glory days. The gloom that engulfed Wolves in the summer is oft-cited but worth repeating in any attempt to fairly assess what has followed. Fan favourites departed as the demands of profit-and-sustainability regulations became clear. Julen Lopetegui left in frustration. What hope if even the manager did not believe? O'Neil was not unaware of ""how many pundits and media had written the group off and how many bottom threes we were predicted to be in"" when he walked through the door just days before Wolves' season kicked off away to Manchester United at Old Trafford. But he galvanised the group quickly, his diligence winning over the players - and then the supporters. Beating Manchester City and Tottenham created some memories. Winning away at West Bromwich Albion for the first time in 28 years helped too. Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports with NOW Download the Sky Sports app The togetherness has been striking. Relationships had to be built on the fly but thanks to hours on the training ground and the insights that have helped to improve performances, it is working. O'Neil has simply made so many of these Wolves players better. This has been a tactical triumph. One of the key moments came in the seventh game of the season. There had been some encouraging signs in those first half a dozen Premier League games but only one had been won and none in front of their own fans. That win over Man City had added significance because O'Neil tweaked the team's shape, adding another defender in Toti Gomes. He has started every game since and, as of Sunday, Wolves could claim to have picked up as many points as City since that day.  It represented a return to the 3-4-3 shape that Nuno Espirito Santo had used to such good effect when taking Wolves to back-to-back seventh-place finishes. But it was more flexible. O'Neil even sees it as a back four at times. Crucially, it is much more attacking. Consider the roles of the two midfielders. Wolves had good control with Ruben Neves and Joao Moutinho, both players remaining heroes to the supporters even after leaving. But what they did not really do, particularly under Nuno, is threaten the penalty box. In 109 appearances each in the competition under Nuno, Neves and Moutinho had 28 and 24 touches inside the penalty box, respectively. Mario Lemina, the senior man in Wolves' current two-man midfield, has eclipsed that tally in just 20 games under O'Neil. Wolves get players into the box now. There was no great reason to expect Lemina to be making a move beyond the last line of defence deep into stoppage time against Spurs in November. But the fact that he made that run allowed him to score the winner. Against Chelsea, it was Rayan Ait-Nouri making a run across the front post to latch onto Pedro Neto's cross and put Wolves in front for the first time. Players inside the box have transformed an attack that most assumed could not score the goals required. After Wolves blanked in that opener against United despite having more shots than any away side in a Premier League game at Old Trafford in over a decade, this reporter asked O'Neil whether he really believed these players could deliver in front of goal. ""If we have 23 shots every game and still have not scored, then I will be concerned,"" he replied. ""At this moment, I see players of real quality, players who are capable. My job is to keep getting them to arrive. My job is to work with them on being more clinical."" At the start of September, upon losing away to Crystal Palace, there was still more than a little scepticism when O'Neil said: ""We had 60 final-third entries, which is a lot for an away game, and more than Palace."" But he was right. And the goals soon did begin to flow. The potent trio of Matheus Cunha, Pedro Neto and Hee-Chan Hwang, currently away on Asian Cup duty with South Korea, have defied the doubters. ""I would bet that all of them are pretty close to their best at the moment, returns-wise,"" says O'Neil. And he is right. This is already the best scoring season of Cunha's career. Hwang has doubled his previous-best total in a major European league. Pedro Neto ranks third in the Premier League for assists. He has eight of them so far, despite missing two months due to injury. The temptation when watching Wolves in full flow is to think that the three have been unleashed, talented players given the freedom to express themselves. ""Sometimes the game becomes random,"" says O'Neil, ""and they need to figure stuff out for themselves."" But, for the most part, the opposite is true. The improvement is a result of prescribed movements, patterns of play that had been lacking. Hwang took those instructions on board quickly. Cunha's adaptation process took longer but has been just as spectacular. The Brazilian was always gifted, hence Wolves parting with £43m to bring him to the club last winter. In 2019, he was nominated for the Puskas Award after a sensational solo effort for RB Leipzig against Bayer Leverkusen. A scorer of great goals but not a great goalscorer. Speaking to O'Neil about this in December, he offered an insight into the conversations between player and coach. He had been urging Cunha to pick up the positions that produce results as well as gasps from the crowd. It was about being more effective. ""When you are a No 9, which he has had to be at times this season, we need you to do this and this, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be. OK, Matheus Cunha does this and this really well but he has to do this. You have to. ""People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got? I am trying to work with him on that, which he takes exceptionally well."" That ongoing dialogue appears to have worked. In eight appearances for Wolves in all competitions since Christmas, Cunha has provided three assists and scored six goals, culminating in his hat-trick against Chelsea. Having added goals, he now has it all. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And the football suits these Wolves players better now. This is not a pure counter-attacking team - they rank 12th for possession. But they are in the top half for direct attacks, transitions entering the final third and drives into the box - metrics that hint at their pace. No team has completed more dribbles. Given space in which to attack, this is a Wolves team that can be devastating. Perhaps that explains why they have won as many games against the so-called 'big six' teams as they have against the current bottom six teams in the Premier League table. That challenge of breaking down deeper defences is one that Wolves will need to solve if the improvement is to continue but, speaking to O'Neil, he is aware of this. With the attention to detail that is fast becoming a feature of his coaching, expect him to find the solutions. ""We are not there yet. When Manchester City come, the question is whether you can defend well and you can attack quickly. We need to have the answer to that. You may get some who come to frustrate you a bit, so now it is not going to be on to attack quickly. ""So we need to have a good understanding and try to pick our moments. Trying to give the group enough information so that they can do whatever is put in front of them is where I try to go with it. I have not got them there yet but I will keep working on it."" O'Neil might dispute the notion that there is an obvious first-choice starting line-up. Pablo Sarabia and Tommy Doyle, for instance, continue to make useful contributions. But the imminent prospect of reuniting Hwang with Neto and Cunha is an enticing one. A combination of international commitments, injuries and suspensions means that the side that beat Manchester City has only been seen for 45 minutes since, in the draw with Aston Villa. If this small squad can stay fit then that 60-year goal record will be broken. And the reputation of Gary O'Neil will continue to grow.

136,Hull City 0-1 Swansea City: Liam Cullen earns Swans first win since New Year's Day,https://www.skysports.com/football/hull-city-vs-swansea/report/485065,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Hull's Sky Bet Championship play-off hopes suffered a blow with a disappointing 1-0 defeat against Swansea at the MKM Stadium. The Tigers had gone into the game in the top six, but it was the visitors who eased their relegation fears by claiming all three points. Swansea went ahead after 10 minutes as Liam Cullen got on the end of a corner from the left to steer a low shot into the bottom-left corner and the home side struggled to create clear scoring chances in response. Josh Tymon created the first opening for the visitors after seven minutes but his driven cross from the left was too quick for any of his team-mates to connect with in the Hull box. With 10 minutes gone, Swansea forced the first corner which Tymon swung in low from the left and Cullen ran in unmarked to steer a left-foot shot inside the near post. Hull tried to respond, and Anass Zaroury swung in a cross from the left but it was too far in front of Regan Slater's run to threaten the Swansea goal. The Swans should have had a second after 22 minutes when the ball came in from the right, but Przemyslaw Placheta headed back across the area when he should have aimed for an open goal. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Hull were getting punished for mistakes and only a tackle in his own area by Slater halted another attack before Ronald fired over following a free-kick. Ozan Turfan headed straight at Carl Rushworth when the ball dropped to him in the area with Hull's best chance on the half-hour. A surging run by Jaden Philogene was halted by Ben Cabango's foul but the fact the Tigers wasted the free-kick was indicative of a lacklustre first-half display and they trailed at the break. A raking pass down the middle from Alfie Jones found Turfan just offside as he ran towards the Swansea goal in the opening minutes of the second half. Billy Sharp replaced Lewie Coyle after 54 minutes and nearly made an instant impact as he reached Turfan's through ball before Rushworth, but Nathan Wood got back to clear his prodded shot just short of goal. Cullen nearly had his second when Hull failed to clear a cross but steered his shot just wide of a post. Tymon fired in a cross from the left which Ryan Allsop beat away at his near post for a corner, but Swansea could not repeat their first-half goal as Jamie Paterson fired his volley off target. Philogene forced Rushworth to save with his knees at the near post as the home side looked for a late equaliser. Allsop beat away a rising shot from Tymon and then gathered the loose ball as Swansea pushed for a second goal, but they had already done enough to claim the points. Hull's Liam Rosenior: ""We didn't deserve anything today. One of the few times I can say that since I've been here. ""When you do that, you give the opposition momentum. Credit to Swansea, we gave them a leg up and they won the game. ""If we mark the player properly we don't get blocked. That's the things we work on in training. ""One, our performance wasn't good enough by our standards, and two, we've cost ourselves a point. ""We gave the ball away cheaply and when you do that you give the opposition energy, you give them oxygen. ""I told (the players) what we have to improve on. We have to bounce back from the setbacks. We need to learn on the job."" Swansea's Luke Williams: ""I think the players deserved that, a fantastic performance and even more fantastic result. ""There are quite a few things, the openings that we made were very deliberate. ""I loved the work-of-art set-piece, and the players delivered on that and scored. ""When you watch Alan go to work on a set-piece and then see the players deliver on that it's a privilege. ""We scored a goal away from home against a very good team and the back-line led us well, they kept us aggressive. ""Liam has come in said 'I need to do the same level of work that Jerry has done and take my chance'. ""We have lovely competition between these two players, it's good to develop this kind of rivalry within the team. ""I really felt a strong positive energy in the changing room going into this game and we played like we believed."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

Simon Adingra had equalised with the host nation's first shot on target in the 90th minute to send it to extra-time, and Diakit completed a thrilling comeback by scoring in what was the 122nd minute of the game. It prompted wild celebrations among nearly 40,000 fans in the Stadium of the Peace in Bouak and beyond. Diakit was booked for excessive celebrations and was sent off as it was his second yellow card. He will miss the semi-final against DR Congo on Wednesday. Ivory Coast had been heading for a disappointing exit after Mali substitute Nene Dorgeles broke the deadlock with a brilliant strike from distance inside the top right corner in the 71st minute.

Liam Kitching deflected the ball in from the set-piece from the left in the sixth and final minute, which had cannoned off two defenders before finding the net to snatch the point, which saw them climb into the top six of the table. Top-scorer Morgan Whittaker had smashed in his 17th Championship goal of the season to fire Argyle ahead against high-flying City at a rain-soaked Home Park in the 54th minute. Ellis Simms equalised 11 minutes later for the visitors, only for Mikel Miller to restore Plymouth's lead in the 68th minute. But Coventry earned a point thanks to Kitching's late intervention. Whittaker went close for Plymouth in the opening five minutes, forcing Brad Collins into action at his near post. At the other end, Conor Hazard had to be alert to save a speculative 10th-minute Matt Godden strike before going full stretch to keep out Milan van Ewijk's angled drive. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports The Plymouth keeper was again called into action in the 24th minute as Victor Torp tried his luck from 25 yards, with Coventry continuing to press. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a rare home attack, Lino Sousa's cross from the left set up Alfie Devine, but he dragged his first-time effort wide. Godden missed a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the 35th minute. Jake Bidwell's pinpoint cross from the left found the striker, but he could only head wide past the far post from close range. Home forward Ryan Hardie could not beat Collins after skipping past two defenders and breaking into the box. Whittaker skimmed the outside of the net just before half-time with a 20-yard left-footed strike. Coventry started the second half as they finished the first, in the ascendancy, with Godden forcing a save from Hazard and Kasey Palmer skimming a 25-yard shot just wide in the 50th minute. The hosts opened the scoring through Whittaker, who took his season's goal tally to 18 to ignite the contest five minutes later. Whittaker was unmarked as he ran on to meet Adam Randell's cross from the left with a cool, first-time finish from close range. Coventry levelled through Simms, who ran on to a superb, defence-splitting pass from Torp to beat Hazard at the second attempt. Northern Ireland keeper Hazard saved Simms' initial effort but, on an increasingly slippery surface, could not hold on to the ball as the visiting striker followed up to score. The Sky Blues' parity was short-lived as Argyle substitute wing-back Miller cut in from the left and let fly three minutes later. The ball deflected off Coventry defender Bobby Thomas, wrong-footing the diving Collins, to put Plymouth ahead. However, the hosts were denied all three points at the death thanks to Kitching. Plymouth's Ian Foster: ""We never get too excited when we win or too disappointed when we lose. ""Tonight is a difficult one. It feels like a defeat, it's another point closer to where we want to be. ""I think you are always in danger to become too emotional, particularly after the game. ""We are disappointed in the manner of the (last) goal, and not to come away with all three points. ""Taking the emotion out of the game, we are quite pleased with how we played the game."" Coventry's Mark Robins: ""We managed to score at the last knockings and ended up getting a point from a position where we didn't look like we would get anything. ""We were in total control in the first half, they are a good attacking side, with pace and a real threat. ""We got ourselves back into the game, but we didn't defend properly. We allowed them to play outside, attack outside and allowed them to get crosses in and we didn't defend those crosses properly. ""We looked a little bit lacklustre, but we attacked pretty well. ""It was a decent attacking game with chances either side. The decision-making was poor and we need to get on the training ground and work, but we haven't got time. ""There was some good attacking play, but we have to be more ruthless."" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play. Entries by 3pm Saturday."

The Blues were unbeaten in their group stage campaign, winning four and drawing two games in Group D as they finished top of their table ahead of BK Hacken. Now, they face Ajax. The Dutch side had reached the Champions League group stage for the first time in its current iteration in the women's game. The first legs will be played on either March 19 or 20 with the second legs the following week on March 27 or 28.

Should the Women's Super League and LigaF sides be successful, it will be the second year in a row that Chelsea and Barcelona will meet in the final four. Last year, Barcelona were 2-1 winners on aggregate. They won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg before a 1-1 draw in the return fixture saw them through.

We'll need to use all our power and experience. They're a top team and deserve to be where they are. ""We would never, ever be disrespectful to Ajax.

SK Brann vs Barcelona Benfica vs Lyon Ajax vs Chelsea BK Hacken vs PSG SK Brann or Barcelona vs Ajax or Chelsea Benfica or Lyon vs BK Hacken or PSG Hayes has revealed her love of Star Wars as she described the sci-fi franchise as having messages that are ""so essential in life"". Hayes' side, in what will be their final campaign under her before she steps down to take charge of the United States national team, are navigating a busy schedule with Wednesday's League Cup quarter-final against Sunderland their sixth game in 18 days. And when asked at a press conference ahead of the tie if the fact it is the last season of her tenure gave her extra energy, the 47-year-old gave an unexpected response. ""To be honest with you The Force Awakens, that gave me a lot of inspiration last night,"" Hayes said with a smile. ""And I'm certain the resistance continue to inspire, and we can keep at bay that evil empire. And for now, all I'm thinking about is I need to get on to The Mandalorian."" Hayes, who has a five-year-old son, was later asked if she watched Star Wars with the eyes of a football manager, and she said: ""I think the messages throughout Star Wars, now I'm watching it as an adult, are so essential in life, about the power of love and the dangers of hate. ""And teaching a five-year-old why it's important not to give into hate…When we have our light sabre moments - I'm pretty good on the light sabre, I'm always Darth Vader which slightly annoys me - I constantly remind him of the importance of community and looking after your people, much like the resistance did. ""And as he always says to me, the republic will remain intact as long as we defeat the evil empire. ""So, yes, essence of the message, always have skilled finishers like the Jedi knights, have the ability to deliver a fatal hit into the Death Star.

141,South Asians in Football Weekly: Singh lands Blues role as Mahmood stars in West Brom's win over Derby,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13064721/south-asians-in-football-weekly-singh-lands-blues-role-as-mahmood-stars-in-west-broms-win-over-derby,Dev Trehan,Publish time not found,"The latest edition of South Asians in Football Weekly is out after another decent week for the community in the Beautiful Game... Panjabi Blues co-founder Sukh Singh will head up Birmingham City's landmark new Official Supporters' Clubs (OSC) network. Singh has emerged as a prominent figure in a number of force-for-good initiatives at Blues in recent years, with his Panjabi Blues group raising more than £11,500 for Blue Nose Day in December, in support of Birmingham City's partnership with the Birmingham Children's Trust after organising the very first 'Sleep Out at St Andrews'. An instantly recognisable figure at matches home and away, Singh was part of Birmingham City's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion steering group last season. He also appeared live on Sky Sports News to react to the announcement Tom Brady had become a minority owner in the club. Singh, who will work to represent supporters' interests alongside fellow Platinum away member Paul Delves, told Sky Sports News: ""It is an honour and a privilege to serve a wonderful institution like Birmingham City Football Club. Our club has supporters in every corner of the globe, and together we all want to see us up there with the very best when it comes to fans, football and entertainment. ""The official supporters club give us a unique opportunity to properly unite, bringing Blues fans everywhere closer to the club and making them part of the special journey that this football club is embarking upon."" News of Singh's appointment comes less than a week after British-Pakistani wonderkid Layla Banaras joined Wolves Women on a dual registration for the remainder of the season.

Banaras now looks set to make her Wolves debut against WSL opposition this weekend, with Wolves hosting Brighton in a Women's FA Cup fifth-round tie. Speaking after completing the deal to bring Banaras in, Wolves manager Dan McNamara said: ""She's a really talented individual, technically very good and we're really looking forward to seeing her on the pitch. ""She can play in numerous positions. She can play in midfield, out wide, at full-back and is really comfortable on the ball and has a really good eye for a pass. ""She's a young player who we can give opportunities to play senior football and see if we can help her along in her journey."" Head of women and girls football Jenna Burke-Martin added: ""Layla is a really talented player with an exciting future ahead of her in football and we look forward to welcoming her into the pack."" Banaras, meanwhile, has become a youth ambassador for Birmingham Housing Week in an effort to encourage young people to get involved in the conversation around housing in England's Second City and what that could look like for future generations. Banaras said: ""I think it's really important to create opportunities for young people as it gives them a voice and allows them to feel heard."" Mariam Mahmood grabbed an assist before scoring West Brom's winner in a stunning 2-1 victory against Kira Rai's Derby County. Simran Jhamat and Mahmood both featured for West Brom, with Rai starting for the visitors as three girls from South Asian backgrounds took to the pitch in a keenly contested Midlands derby at Redditch United's Valley Stadium. Mahmood, who returned to the line-up after injury to make her first West Brom appearance of 2024, looked on her game from the first whistle, starting on the left flank as manager Siobhan Hodgetts-Still fielded an attacking line-up for the visit of the Ewes. The 19-year-old attacker skinned Derby County's full-back and squared for Niamh Deasy to convert West Brom's opener, before smashing home what proved to be the winner after a delightful, flicked pass from Phoebe Warner. There was also a touching moment during the first half when Derby County midfielder Amy Sims needed treatment for a head injury, with Rai joining the club's medical staff to tend to her stricken team-mate during a 15-minute delay. Pakistan international Zahmena Malik is the latest British player to make a move to Saudi Arabia. Jordan Henderson might have cut short his stint in the country to join Ajax, but Leicester-born Nigeria international Ashleigh Plumptre is still playing in Saudi, with Malik now joining her after completing a move to Riyadh-based Al Hmmah. Former Spurs academy star Malik played at London Seaward last season, with her stunning form earning her an international call-up. Malik grabbed a memorable 89th-minute assist on her international debut in a historic clash against Comoros last year, with Pakistan's women playing African opposition for the first time. The east Londoner, who featured in last year's launch of the first South Asian heritage female player timeline, scored Pakistan's winner in an Olympic qualifier against Tajikistan last April. ""Zahmena has been an amazing find for the Pakistan National Team and having scored the country's winning goal in our first-ever Olympic qualifying win, it's clear that she can certainly play at a high level in Asia,"" Footballistan podcast host Shahrukh Sohail told Sky Sports News. ""Al Hmmah are an ambitious club who are well-positioned to challenge at the higher echelons of the game in Saudi Arabia in coming years."" Former Aston Villa midfielder Arjan Raikhy followed up on his FA Cup appearance for Leicester City, by making his Championship debut in a 3-1 victory for the Foxes against Swansea City. Raikhy started for Leicester's U21s, two days after making an appearance in the 3-0 FA Cup win over Birmingham City, before coming on as a substitute in the win against the Swans less than 24 hours later. Sky Sports News exclusively revealed back in August Raikhy had signed for Leicester as a free agent after leaving Villa where he had been part of the FA Youth Cup-winning team. Raikhy made his senior debut in English football in an FA Cup third-round tie against Liverpool in 2021.

142,Brentford 1-3 Man City: Phil Foden leads City turnaround with hat-trick as champions move two points off top,https://www.skysports.com/football/brentford-vs-man-city/report/482813,Ron Walker,Publish time not found,"Phil Foden ensured Man City took advantage of Liverpool's slip at Arsenal to move within two points of the leaders as his hat-trick saw them come from behind to win 3-1 at Brentford. The treble winners were stunned as Neal Maupay latched onto Mark Flekken's long goal-kick for a route-one opener after 21 minutes, and they found the Brentford goalkeeper in inspired form as they sought an equaliser. But just as Arsenal and Liverpool - both of whom have played a game more than City - were beginning to let themselves hope, Brentford's resistance was broken when Ethan Pinnock's weak clearance allowed Foden a simple finish moments before the break. The midfielder then kept City's charge back towards the top on track when he ghosted in to meet Kevin De Bruyne's deep cross to complete the turnaround eight minutes into the second half. Foden completed his own personal milestone with the second hat-trick of his career after latching onto Erling Haaland's lay-off and coolly slotting home a third 20 minutes from time to seal City's fifth successive league win, and 15th-placed Brentford's seventh defeat in eight. Brentford: Flekken (7), Collins (6), Pinnock (6), Mee (7), Roerslev (7), Norgaard (7), Jensen (5), Janelt (5), Reguilon (7), Maupay (7), Toney (6).

Subs: Lewis-Potter (5), Yarmolyuk (6), Damsgaard (6), Ajer (6), Baptiste (n/a).

Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Dias (7), Ake (6), Gvardiol (7), Rodri (8), Silva (6), De Bruyne (8), Alvarez (7), Foden (10), Haaland (7).

Subs: Doku (7), Kovacic (n/a).

Player of the match: Phil Foden. Brentford's pre-match video played around the ground reminded anyone still in doubt about their role as the only team to do a Premier League double over City in 2022/23. Few gave them a chance of making it a hat-trick, but the hoodoo would not go quietly. From the Bees' first chance of the game, Maupay slotted them ahead, latching onto Flekken's long goal-kick after Ivan Toney held off Nathan Ake. Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App The City defence had anticipated Toney getting a touch which would have ruled the Frenchman offside, but it never came. They would have envisaged an easier night against Flekken, too, given no team had saved a lower proportion of shots on target than Brentford this season coming into the game. But they found the Dutchman in inspired form as he twice denied Julian Alvarez with full-length stops, though his sprawling save to keep out an Erling Haaland effort with his right boot was the pick of the bunch. It made the manner of Man City's equaliser on the stroke of the interval feel all the harsher, when Pinnock's weak header under little pressure fell kindly for Foden and left the goalkeeper helpless to stop him levelling up. He was less blameless for the midfielder's second, a free header he could only get a glancing hand to, but Foden had been given the freedom of the penalty area after ghosting in between two defenders. The pick of the bunch was yet to come. With Pinnock and Nathan Collins both lured towards Erling Haaland, the striker's deft lay-off found Foden again untracked as he danced into the Brentford box and slotted home for his hat-trick. Brentford could have given themselves hope of taking something from the game but for an acrobatic volley blazed over by Toney and a Christian Norgaard volley which was blocked by Ruben Dias at close range. The hosts still paraded the pitch come the full-time whistle, following a performance making up in heart what it lacked in quality, while Foden led the charge to the away end with the match ball in hand and City's surge to the top in full flow, their hopes of a fourth successive title firmly in their own hands. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher on Monday Night Football: ""Why isn't it a possibility? They're going to be favourites for every competition they're in. I don't see anyone close to them, too much, in the Champions League. ""They've got over that barrier last season by putting that to bed in terms of winning it - and they're big favourites in the other two as well. ""From Arsenal and Liverpool's point of view, there will be a sense that City are back and they're going to go on another long run. ""Arsenal and Liverpool have both got to play City. If you're going to win the league, you're going to have to beat City. You're going to be favourites in the other games you go into, so it's important for the players, staff and supporters not to get too downhearted with what Manchester City are doing. ""Forget City. When you play them, do the job, but apart from that just concentrate on your own game and drag it out for as long as possible. Then, who knows what can happen?"" Sky Sports' Ron Walker at the Gtech Community Stadium: ""It takes some reminding that Phil Foden is still only 23 years old. The way he ghosts into space - like for his second goal - and how he glides past defenders - like for his third - are not something you would associate with a player still a few years from their prime. ""There is credence to Pep Guardiola's assertion that Foden is among the most dangerous players in tight spaces he has ever worked with. ""It always seemed like he would end up playing in a more central role at some point given that priceless quality. And now he is thriving in it. ""Haaland was the perfect foil for two of his three goals, drawing two defenders towards him on both occasions and leaving space for Foden to work his magic. Not everyone would anticipate that and react accordingly, but he is as intelligent as he is technically gifted. ""Two questions remain. Where does he fit for England - because surely, he fits somewhere - and how far can he go from here? ""At international level, the left flank seems the likely fit given his experience there for Man City and Gareth Southgate's current preference to play Jude Bellingham as his most advanced central midfielder. ""In terms of his potential, it's perhaps best to channel his club manager and mentor. 'His limits, he will decide,' he said when asked to ponder that same thought. ""Given what Foden has decided in his short career to this point, that may well mean there is still plenty more to come."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brentford manager Thomas Frank on Sky Sports: ""I think overall it was a good performance - especially in the first half but actually throughout the game. We defended very well and we limited them to shots outside the box except the chance to Haaland in that first half due to our own poor back pass. ""The boys defended so well but then make a minor mistake for 1-1. We talked a lot about closing down De Bruyne but then he made an unbelievably precise pass and they showed the quality for 2-1. ""We had a big chance for Norgaard and for Ivan and those are the chances we have to take to beat the best team in the world."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Man City manager Pep Guardiola on Sky Sports: ""It was a very tough game as what they do from experience, at corners, is really hard to defend against. The way they link with Toney is unstoppable. But we had a lot of shots in the first half and their goalkeeper was amazing. ""I think we deserved it but at the same time we were fortunate to go in 1-1 at half time. ""In the second half, we were much better."" On Foden: ""He's a guy who can play in so many positions but he likes to play in the pockets. To have a player who can play in these tight spaces is really important. ""He's a guy who has a lot of weapons. He's playing his best season since we've been together. His goals and assists in this central position is unbelievable.""

145,Leicester 2-0 Sheffield Wednesday: Abdul Fatawu and Jamie Vardy seal comfortable win for Foxes,https://www.skysports.com/football/leicester-vs-sheff-wed/report/485076,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Leicester strengthened their position at the top of the Sky Bet Championship as captain Jamie Vardy scored against his boyhood club in a 2-0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at King Power Stadium. Enzo Maresca's side had the game won by half-time and are now 14 points clear of third-placed Southampton as they close in on promotion back to the Premier League. Vardy, who was released by the Owls for being too small as a teenager, also played a part in the opening goal for Abdul Fatawu after four minutes. Vardy started a game for the first time in more than two months and, coincidentally, the last Championship game he was on from the start was against Wednesday. But this was a genuine team display with threats from all over the pitch in a commanding performance against Danny Rohl's struggling side. Leicester took an early lead after a mix-up in the visitors' defence. Goalkeeper James Beadle's short pass put Will Vaulks in trouble with Dennis Praet close by. The ball fell to Kieran Dewsbury-Hall who delivered a cross meant for Vardy - but his step-over allowed the ball to go through for Fatawu and he tapped into an empty net. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Wednesday struggled against Leicester's slick style of play with Harry Winks, Vardy and Dewsbury-Hall all causing problems. On the half-hour, Dewsbury-Hall twisted and put in a cross which defender Wout Faes could only hook over the crossbar. But Leicester extended their lead nine minutes before half-time when a long ball from Faes found Dewsbury-Hall and he neatly set up the chance for Vardy to score with an angled drive. It was his 11th goal of the season and made him Leicester's top scorer. The Owls briefly threatened to pull a goal back when Djeidi Gassama's long-range shot was saved by Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Wednesday substitute Anthony Musaba then sent a shot inches past the far post as the game passed the hour mark. Vardy received a standing ovation when he was substituted with 10 minutes to go. Leicester were able to play out the final minutes under no pressure, although there were some encouraging signs for Rohl in the second half. Leicester's Enzo Maresca: ""If any of my players show a drop, I will change them, even after two minutes. ""They won't play. We aren't changing anything, we have to keep winning and we have to respect our opponents. ""I'm very happy with this win, but now the focus moves on to Saturday when we play Middlesbrough. ""We struggled a little when they changed shape in the second half, but after about 15 or 20 minutes we were OK. ""But I wanted a third goal before half-time to make us more comfortable, if they score one they can come back."" Sheffield Wednesday's Danny Rohl: ""We showed a lot more in the second half and I was happier with our reaction to going behind. We changed to a back five but it was more having the belief. ""There was an improvement, but against Leicester you need to be good for 90 minutes and we had one good half. ""That was the positive thing we can take from the game and I think our supporters at the end recognised our second-half performance. ""This is what we can do if we are on the front foot, the data showed that. If we could have had one goal, then maybe we can try to do something. ""At Leicester it is a challenge, but we always wanted to try to get something. We drew with them at home. We know how strong they are, they are outstanding. But we reacted better than we did against Southampton. ""What we have to do now is come to every game and take as many points as we can.""

146,Roberto De Zerbi to Liverpool? Brighton boss is playing beautiful and brilliant football so where is the clamour?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/13065213/roberto-de-zerbi-to-liverpool-brighton-boss-is-playing-beautiful-and-brilliant-football-so-where-is-the-clamour,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"The style with which Roberto De Zerbi has established Brighton in the top half of the Premier League table, this season and last, demands that the 44-year-old coach be considered for the biggest jobs. Strangely, that style also raises questions. That is always the way when a coach has had success with fewer resources. Will that relative success be repeated when the expectation is that wins are delivered every week and results such as the recent 4-0 defeat at Luton could spark talk of a crisis? With De Zerbi, there is an unusual twist to this familiar tale. When Sam Allardyce and Sean Dyche took unfashionable teams into the upper reaches of the Premier League, the concern was that their approach would not be ambitious enough for the very best. In De Zerbi's case, could it be too ambitious for cautious owners? The good news for Brighton is that those are the whispers following reports that he is under consideration for the soon-to-be vacant role at Liverpool. Xabi Alonso has less coaching experience but it is De Zerbi whose fascinating football is seen as a risk. In full flow, his teams find angles that others do not, triangles all over the pitch, controlling the rhythm in possession and pressing man-to-man out of it. At its very best, watching his Brighton side can feel like watching the future of the sport, evolution in action. Pep Guardiola has called De Zerbi ""one of the most influential managers in the last 20 years"" because of this brand of football. The three-time Champions League-winning coach continued: ""There is no team playing the way they play. It is unique."" Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports with NOW Download the Sky Sports app But can De Zerbi really be both unique and uniquely influential? Many have sought to copy Guardiola's game, inferior versions of it abound. De Zerbi may be informing the thinking of other coaches, Mikel Arteta included, but none are seeking to replicate it entirely. Perhaps there are parallels here with Marcelo Bielsa, the celebrated Argentine coach who has inspired so many but been overlooked for Europe's biggest jobs. He too is regarded as a maverick who changed the way coaches think with his interpretation of the game. De Zerbi once wrote to him when the Italian was in charge of Palermo in 2016 and was invited to observe Bielsa's Lille team train, spending time together discussing their ideas. ""If he is supposed to be crazy,"" said De Zerbi, ""then I would like to be the same."" Putting this question to Bielsa in an exclusive interview in 2022, he was typically firm in his response when asked whether he saw others copying his ideas. He stuck to the facts rather than the pleasant fiction. For all the praise, no top coach chose to do it like him. ""I sincerely do not,"" Bielsa told Sky Sports. ""There are a lot of coaches who it has been said follow my ideas but that is not the case. I want to make it clear that those who are said to follow my ideas have clearly said themselves that this is not the case."" De Zerbi's own vertical approach focuses more on possession than pressing but it is similarly eye-catching when it works and alarming when it does not. Naturally, surrendering the ball in your own defensive third of the pitch is more likely to result in conceding. Brighton have made seven errors leading to goals this season, the joint-most by any team in the Premier League along with bottom club Sheffield United. That commitment to playing out from the back comes at a price. De Zerbi's admirers would argue, with some justification, that it is worth it. When Brighton play through the opposition, it is both beautiful and brilliantly effective. They may have conceded more than any top-half team but they are also the sixth-highest scorers. With better players, would De Zerbi's football be even more impressive and, crucially, less likely to result in errors? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  According to Opta, two of those mistakes resulting in a goal go against the name of goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen with Carlos Baleba and the defensive quartet of Lewis Dunk, Adam Webster, Joel Veltman and Jan Paul van Hecke responsible for one apiece. Substitute in the names of Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk, for instance, and the hope might be that there would be fewer errors in possession and more examples of the team playing through the opposition press to good effect. De Zerbi's football embraced by some of the world's best? That is the dream. But there might be a good reason why Liverpool and the rest do not commit fully to this style of play. After all, if you have the best players, maybe a less risky approach just makes sense. To elevate his reputation beyond the coaching community and football's aesthetes, De Zerbi will needs trophies as well as admirers. That was the appeal of his move to Shakhtar Donetsk. ""To bring my idea of football - and to win. Because that counts too."" He was unfortunate that circumstances beyond his control denied him that opportunity. Shakhtar were top of the Ukrainian Premier League when the competition was terminated following the invasion of the country. That he had to go there at all is revealing. Arrigo Sacchi, that great Italian innovator - and winner - pointed that out in a recent column for Gazzetta dello Sport. Maybe he was speaking from experience when he noted that ""whoever brings new ideas is always seen negatively"" but he is a De Zerbi fan. ""I consider him the most exciting coach of this generation, so I feel he is ready to sit on an important bench. I am sorry that no Italian club, based on reports, is trying to get him. The same happened a few years ago when he went to Ukraine and then to England."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Italy is certainly open to coaches moving through the system. Massimiliano Allegri and Stefano Pioli were both in charge of Sassuolo early in their careers too - and not in the top division like De Zerbi - before going on to become Serie A winning managers. But they were not seen to be as dangerous as De Zerbi. There will always be doubts whether a coach can adapt to the demands of a bigger job. Jurgen Klopp and Xavi Hernandez are walking away from Liverpool and Barcelona respectively in the summer, citing their energy levels. The pressures are vast. The spotlight tests character, the profile of player challenges man-management. These are factors worthy of consideration. The odd thing about the De Zerbi conundrum for football's risk-averse super clubs is that they know the football that he plays is beautiful. They just have not yet seen anyone try it and win. But if they wait for De Zerbi to do that elsewhere, they may regret it. Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."

Since then, the Swedish defender completed a January transfer window move to the WSL leaders, who take on City at Kingsmeadow. ""Bunny is a really good football player.

149,Sarina Wiegman: England Women boss urges FIFA and UEFA to make changes to calendar and protect players,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13070947/sarina-wiegman-england-women-boss-urges-fifa-and-uefa-to-make-changes-to-calendar-and-protect-players,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Sarina Wiegman has urged FIFA and UEFA to make changes to the women's football calendar and provide ""proper rest"" periods for elite players. On Tuesday, Wiegman named her squad for England's friendlies against Austria and Italy later this month, when the Lionesses will be without Millie Bright and Bethany England. Wiegman also had to make do without several players for the World Cup last summer, with Leah Williamson and Beth Mead both missing due to ACL injuries. The number of serious knee injuries suffered by players in the women's game is one of the factors that has led to calls for the fixture schedule to be altered - and Wiegman wants the governing bodies to take action. ""We have a June window. Then after that, there's the Olympics, which is not for us. Then at the beginning of September, there's Champions League again. What the players ask all the time is: 'Where is the rest for us?'"" said the England boss. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""They want to compete, and we want the players fit and fresh. That means you always need rest - a proper rest. You need to train in June and July, too. ""We have had conversations with clubs - those have been very good - but we still don't have a solution for that period. Women's Super League fixtures Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports app ""FIFA and UEFA need to solve that for the players. I don't want to get in the same situation with the players and clubs that we had last year - no one wants that. ""When we talk about the calendar from 2025 on, this really needs to be solved. Yes, it's complex at moments, but players at the highest level, the demands are so high that they need a proper rest in between seasons."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wiegman added: ""It starts with the FIFA calendar. I know that's complex. Then it's UEFA and the Champions League. ""The Women's Super League starts a little later next season but you can't have rest if you play in the first round of the Champions League. ""The federations need to adapt to that, too. If you adapt a little bit then you can build in rest for players. That's what we really need to do. ""We need to stay connected, we need to communicate and we need to have the right people around the table to make the decision, and to know what the consequences are."" England reached the World Cup final last summer, meaning they played seven matches in Australia and New Zealand. The Lionesses then played six Nations League matches between September and December. After two friendlies this month, England will play six Euro 2025 qualifiers between April and July. As a result, Wiegman's side will have played 21 matches in the 12 months since the start of the World Cup. England's schedule would have been even more congested had they qualified for the Olympics, which take place in July and August. What is more, England's players must also contend with a packed calendar at club level. For example, Chelsea - England's sole representative in the Champions League - could play up to 11 games in Europe. The Blues will also play 22 WSL fixtures and could play as many as five in the FA Cup and three in the League Cup - meaning a total of 41 in all competitions. As a result, a Chelsea and England player who played at the World Cup and was available for every one of their team's fixtures during the 2023/24 season could play up to 62 matches for club and country during the calendar year. Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The fact that Sarina Wiegman is able to call on Leah Williamson again is a huge boost, particularly in light of Millie Bright's extended absence. Curiously, Wiegman stayed coy on Williamson's position as captain, presumably because she's been out of the fold for close to a year. A lot has happened since then. Williamson is yet to play a full 90 since her injury return and competitive minutes will need managing. Perhaps Wiegman will take this opportunity to test the waters - England haven't had the luxury of many international windows playing only friendly fixtures. The Dutchwoman was also quick to point out that others have stepped up admirably in the Arsenal defender's wake. I've particularly liked what I've seen in a leadership capacity from Georgia Stanway - she has captain energy. Mary Earps has also come to the fore. She led the side during a difficult December and is a commanding figure, reliable too. She'd be a popular appointment. Goalkeepers: Mary Earps (Man Utd), Khiara Keating (Man City), Hannah Hampton (Chelsea). Defenders: Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Jess Carter (Chelsea), Niamh Charles (Chelsea), Esme Morgan (Man City), Alex Greenwood (Man City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Leah Williamson (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Man Utd). Midfielders: Grace Clinton (Tottenham), Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Jess Park (Man City), Keira Walsh (Barcelona), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Man Utd). Forwards: Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Rachel Daly (Aston Villa), Lauren Hemp (Man City), Chloe Kelly (Man City), Lauren James (Chelsea), Beth Mead (Arsenal).

And lots of them. Hojlund was United's big-money striker signing last summer but, despite grabbing five goals in six Champions League group games, he had to wait until Boxing Day to kick off his first top-flight tally. It is now five in five in the Premier League for the Dane, though, and Maguire expects 21-year-old Hojlund's name to be listed on the scoresheet in United games routinely from now on for many years to come. ""We've seen the talent he has and now it is really clicking for him in front of goal,"" Maguire told Sky Sports. ""We always knew that was going to come because he's an exceptional talent. He's going to be a big player for this club. I'm sure he'll keep scoring goals and there are many more to come. ""As senior players you see a young player coming through - and he holds himself so well and so mature people don't realise his age - but he's come in with a big weight on his shoulders to be the main striker for Man Utd. ""He's had to play every game because of injuries but you see in training the work he puts in, the talent he has, the physical capability to play in this league, we knew he'd be successful for this club."" Man Utd fixtures Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Live football on Sky Sports this week Over the past five games, Hojlund has led a youthful United frontline, featuring Alejandro Garnacho (aged 19) and Marcus Rashford (26), while Kobbie Mainoo (18) posed alongside Hojlund and Garnacho for what looks set to become an iconic photo in the recent win over West Ham. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is the young players bringing energy to United's recent resurgence. ""It's really encouraging, the young boys coming through at this club,"" said Maguire. ""This club has built a philosophy where young players get chances and if you take your chance you stay in the team and this manager has proved that. Since he's come in, the young players train with us a lot and when they train well and impress they stay and get more opportunities to impress. ""It doesn't matter how young you are, if you're playing well you keep your place."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Maguire has reclaimed his place in the team this month. The centre-back lost his spot in the XI at the start of the season and then saw his fight back into contention stalled by injury in December. But fit again and after helping the side to a clean sheet against West Ham and then a 2-1 win at Aston Villa, Maguire moved to underline his belief in what he can add to the team. Boss Erik ten Hag has previously suggested Maguire was not best suited to a role on the left side of central defence but the England international has played there since Lisandro Martinez's injury against West Ham. ""The manager has always reiterated about his philosophies of having a left footer playing left centre-back and a left footer at left-back as well, obviously Victor (Lindelof) had to come in at half-time and play that role [when Luke Shaw was injured vs Villa],"" said Maguire. ""It doesn't matter for me, I'm comfortable playing on the left. It's the manager's philosophy but I'm sure me and Rapha (Varane) can play together and keep clean sheets and win football matches together. ""We haven't had a settled back four for a while. It's been difficult. The injury set me back a little bit and it was frustrating to be out for eight weeks but it's nice to pick up the rhythm again.""

152,Rotherham 1-2 Hull: Liam Rosenior lauds Jaden Philogene as 'ridiculous' skill launches comeback win,https://www.skysports.com/football/rotherham-vs-hull-city/report/485078,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Liam Rosenior believes Jaden Philogene deserves to be credited with Hull's ""ridiculous"" opening goal as they boosted their Championship play-off hopes with a 2-1 win at rock-bottom Rotherham.. The Millers had taken a surprise lead when Christ Tiehi opened the scoring in the fourth minute, but that proved to be far too early for them as Hull scored twice in four second-half minutes. Philogene pulled off a fine bit of skill to beat Ollie Rathbone twice and then produce a rabona that nicked off Cameron Humphreys and into the net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It was officially given as a Humphreys own-goal and then four minutes later Noah Ohio swept home for Hull as they overturned Tiehi's early opener for Rotherham to seal a victory which sees Rosenior's side move into seventh position ahead of another batch of Championship games on Wednesday. Tigers head coach Rosenior joked that the dubious goal panel should award Philogene the goal. ""We should give him the goal, we need to appeal to the FA for the outrageous piece of skill,"" he said. ""He is trying to beg it in the dressing room that it's his goal. I said to him that at least it's an assist. That is Jaden's goal, it's what we pay money for. ""Ridiculous, it's ridiculous, his ability is something we have missed for a long time. He is only going to get better the more games he plays. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports ""It is not just his goal or the showreel moments, it is his energy levels for the team, he has a real belief, he can be a top player but the reason he can be a top player is because he works so hard on his game. ""We have to get him off the training pitch because he wants to do extra."" At the other end of the table, Rotherham look certain to be exiting the division at the other end, sitting 12 points adrift of safety and without a win since Boxing Day. The hosts, however, did make a perfect start and went ahead in the fourth minute as Tiehi latched on to Seb Revan's cross and saw his side-footed effort deflected into the corner. The Millers should have doubled their lead three minutes later as Peter Kioso's header from Sam Clucas' cross was brilliantly clawed away by Ryan Allsop. They could have done with that going in as the visitors launched an assault on the Rotherham goal for the remainder of the match. Goalkeeper Johansson was in inspired form and kept his side in front. The Sweden international palmed away Billy Sharp's header and then produced a miraculous stop to shovel away another from Jacob Greaves before getting down well to save Anass Zaroury's low effort at the near post. The second half also saw Johansson in early action as he kept out Fabio Carvalho's header with a flying save. Rotherham needed to stem the tide and had a rare sighting of goal when Sam Nombe was left free from Kioso's cross but he could not make sufficient contact with his header. Hull's attacking onslaught eventually paid dividends as they equalised in the 71st minute. Former Millers loanee Ryan Giles thundered a shot off the underside of the crossbar and home midfielder Ollie Rathbone played a pass straight to Jaden Philogene, who twisted and turned and then sent in a rabona cross that flicked off Humphreys and into the far corner. Four minutes later Hull took the lead as Giles fired in a low cross for Ohio to sweep into the bottom corner for his first goal for the club. Rotherham have not come from behind to win since last April so that was game over, with Hull returning up the M18 with three points that firmly in the play-off picture with 15 games to go. Rotherham's Leam Richardson: ""Congratulations to Hull, they are having a good season and invested really well in the summer and the January window. ""We wanted to start with a real strong intent, to be in the ascendency and we did that. ""We had a mad five or 10 minutes, I thought we missed a big chance with 1-0 with Sam (Nombe) and they went down the other end and scored. ""Disappointed to concede the way we did. I will never criticise lads for honest mistakes on the pitch but obviously we have to stop making them. ""The Championship is as strong as it has been for 20 years and walking into this situation and this football club I was very aware of it, I could have shied away from it. It's not in my make up. ""I know where this club wants to be and at the end of the season and next season, what we want to sustain. ""Things have got to be put into place to do that moving forward and certainly leaders of the club are aware of it and we will try our best to make positive decisions."" Hull's Liam Rosenior: ""We should give him the goal, we need to appeal to the FA for the outrageous piece of skill. ""He is trying to beg it in the dressing room that it's his goal. I said to him that at least it's an assist. That is Jaden's goal, it's what we pay money for. ""Ridiculous, it's ridiculous, his ability is something we have missed for a long time.

155,Huddersfield 1-0 Sunderland: Matty Pearson steers Terriers to victory,https://www.skysports.com/football/huddsfld-vs-sland/report/485080,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Matty Pearson's first-half goal pulled Huddersfield five points clear of the Championship relegation places with a 1-0 victory over Sunderland at the John Smith's Stadium. Huddersfield were 5-3 beaten by promotion-chasing Southampton at the weekend and their confidence in front of goal showed when Pearson put them in front eight minutes before the break. The Terriers have not lost on their own patch this year and were good value for a second successive home win - they could have had more than the solitary goal but for the woodwork and a goal-line clearance - but needed goalkeeper Lee Nicholls' heroics to secure three points. Huddersfield's first chance came when Sorba Thomas dispossessed Daniel Ballard on the last line of defence and Luke O'Nien's challenge recycled the ball out to a waiting David Kasumu who sliced wide of the target. O'Nien brought Kasumu down outside the area which presented Huddersfield with a good set-piece opportunity on the edge of the area. Jack Rudoni's vicious strike from the free-kick was palmed by Anthony Patterson into the path of Pearson who bundled home from close range. Huddersfield held their breath on the stroke of half-time when a short corner was worked out to Dan Neil, who fired an effort on target which looked to be a routine save for Nicholls, only for it to slip through his grasp out for a corner. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Sunderland were making a habit of giving Huddersfield dangerous free-kicks, this time Trai Hume brought Koroma down and the Huddersfield striker picked himself up and curled the resulting free-kick onto the near post. Sunderland went in search of an equaliser and their first effort on target of the half came when Jobe Bellingham drilled into the gloves of Nicholls. Huddersfield came within the width of the goal-line of doubling their advantage when Rudoni's glancing header was cleared by Bellingham before appeals for handball were swiftly waved away by referee Gavin Ward. Michael Beale rolled the dice with his substitutions in search of a leveller and Patrick Roberts' strike from outside the box looked to be heading in before it was deflected over the bar. The visitors thought they had earned a last-gasp equaliser when Hume was put through on goal only to be denied by the outstretched Nicholls as he magnificently tipped behind. Nicholls was once again the hero in the final minute of added time when O'Nien's cross was diverted towards his own goal by Tom Lees but the Huddersfield keeper sprung well to tip over the bar and earn another vital home win. Huddersfield's interim manager Jon Worthington: ""Another game I really enjoyed - a committed performance from the lads. We had to go again from Saturday's performance, in terms of the result, and I was happy with the desire the lads showed. ""I think it was a real squad effort to make sure we all dug in together to get over the line and the result. ""From the first minute we were on the front foot, wanting to run forward and support each other. "" Sunderland's Michael Beale: ""To concede off a set-piece away from home is not good enough is it? ""It's a pretty standard set-piece we've conceded from before half-time. We had our moments, but it's a bad night. ""It's a disappointing night. I thought Huddersfield made it a physical game and there was a point in the first half when we needed to roll our sleeves up and give a bit back, and I'm not sure we did that. ""On our best day we are slightly better than teams in this league, but I don't think we are going to blow anyone away. We don't score enough goals to blow teams away."" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play. Entries by 3pm Saturday."

Furuhashi finished off a fine move against the run of play after 15 minutes to give the cinch Premiership leaders a slender half-time lead at the SMiSA Stadium. Alex Gogic had come close a couple of times for the Buddies in the first half but the Saints could not find a breakthrough and Maeda pounced from close range in the 52nd minute to double Celtic's lead. St Mirren could not get back into the game and will rue missed chances and although it was not a sparkling performance from a Celtic side who have been unconvincing recently, it kept intact boss Brendan Rodgers' record of not having lost a Scottish Cup tie in two spells at the club. Oscar Cortes shone in his first Rangers start as the Light Blues made their way into the quarter-finals with a 2-0 win over Ayr at Ibrox. The 20-year-old Colombian winger, on loan from French side Lens with an option for the Rangers to buy, had a couple of efforts on goal before he set up Borna Barisic's low drive, which deflected in off Somerset Park midfielder Roy Syla after only 10 minutes. However, Cortes departed after an hour with the Govan side struggling to see off the Championship side, managed by former Celtic captain Scott Brown, before on-loan Wolves striker Fabio Silva added a second in the 76th minute. Latest Scottish football news Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Scottish Premiership on Sky Sports It was far from Rangers' best performance of the season, but Gers boss Philippe Clement, who has already won the Viaplay Cup while hauling his side back into the cinch Premiership title race, will look forward to the next round. Hibernian booked their place in the quarter-finals after their superiority showed in the second half as they recorded a 3-1 victory at Inverness. Myziane Maolida broke the deadlock for Hibernian before Martin Boyle doubled their advantage and Elie Youan scored their third - a minute from time - to ensure the Premiership side are in Sunday's last-eight draw. Aaron Doran pulled one back in second-half stoppage time for the Championship hosts, who rarely threatened to pull off a shock during the match. Tete Yengi headed home a dramatic winner in the last minute of extra-time as Livingston came back from two goals down to claim a 3-2 victory over Partick Thistle. The Jags had taken a 2-0 lead through a first-half thunderbolt from Kerr McInroy and Aidan Fitzpatrick's low near-post finish on the hour mark. But Joel Nouble tapped home shortly after to pull a goal back for the Premiership strugglers and the striker then grabbed his second, firing home superbly from a tight angle to send the game to extra-time. Livingston had the better of the additional 30 minutes but the match looked to be heading for penalties until Yengi's flicked header in the dying seconds completed the comeback to send the visitors into the quarter-finals. Aberdeen eased into the quarter-finals with a 2-0 victory over Bonnyrigg Rose. Bojan Miovski's clinical first-half double was the difference between the sides but, with captain Graeme Shinnie rested after the interval and a number of changes made on the hour mark, Aberdeen's second-half performance was sluggish. Kilmarnock booked their place in the last eight with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Cove Rangers. The hosts survived an early scare when Rumarn Burrell's shot was cleared off the line, before Marley Watkins netted for the second successive game to open the scoring on the stroke of half-time, Derek McInnes' side were dominant after the break, though it would take until the 80th minute for the game to be put beyond doubt, Danny Armstrong drilling low beyond goalkeeper Nick Suman. In-form Morton beat Motherwell 2-1 in the fifth round at Cappielow after Robbie Muirhead's first-half corner caused chaos in the visiting defence. Muirhead's inswinging corner caught out Liam Kelly, who palmed the ball out but saw it ricochet over the line off team-mate Harry Paton. The home side had used their wind advantage to good effect in the first half and kept Motherwell under pressure while the Steelmen struggled to offer any real attacking threat. George Oakley doubled Morton's lead after the break and Motherwell's comeback attempts were too little, too late.

157,Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn: Andre Dozzell scores as John Eustace beaten on return to St Andrew's,https://www.skysports.com/football/birmham-vs-blackburn/report/485074,Author not found,Publish time not found,"New Blackburn boss John Eustace made a losing return to St Andrew's as his side were beaten 1-0 by former club Birmingham. Andre Dozzell struck the only goal of the Sky Bet Championship contest in the 77th minute to end City's 388-minute drought and reward their dominance. Tony Mowbray's side were good value for their first win in four matches, which saw them climb to within a point of 16th-placed Rovers. Marc Roberts hit the post and his namesake Tyler also missed two one-on-one chances for the hosts. Eustace, who watched Saturday's 3-1 win at Stoke from the stands, was back in the familiar surroundings after his sacking as City head coach in October. Birmingham's former Rovers boss Mowbray did not get the chance to enjoy any pre-match pleasantries with 44-year-old Eustace as the City manager was forced to take a seat in the stands, banned for receiving three yellow cards. Koji Miyoshi blotted his copybook when he sized up a shooting chance after a Blues corner was partly cleared, slicing horribly wide. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports However the Japan attacking midfielder got his next involvement right, threading through Tyler Roberts - only for the striker to steer the ball wide when clean through with only goalkeeper Aynsley Pears to beat. Roberts' namesake Marc went even closer to breaking the deadlock in the 35th minute. The towering defender, lingering upfield following a corner, clipped the outside of the post with a glancing header from Miyoshi's hanging cross. Little had been seen of Sammie Szmodics until the 22-goal Blackburn marksman lifted a rising effort narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box. Szmodics forced John Ruddy into his first save when he tried to catch the veteran keeper out with a quick first-time effort which the former Wolves man palmed around the post. Birmingham then wasted two chances in quick succession. After Marc powered a header over from close range from Dozzell's free-kick, Tyler Roberts skied high and wide from six yards out after Pears completely mishit a pass to leave him one-on-one. The hosts lost their momentum and Mowbray made a double switch, bringing Juninho Bacuna and Siriki Dembele on for Paik Seung-ho and Miyoshi. Dembele flashed a rising angled effort over the bar after Tyler Roberts teed him up deep inside the box. Dozzell spared City's blushes when he finally poked home 13 minutes from time. The scrappy goal came after Dozzell and Adam Stansfield had shots blocked before Cody Drameh's cross fell back into his path off Kyle McFadzean's foot. Birmingham's Tony Mowbray: ""It was an important, big, three points because you can't keep having 23, 25 shots a game but keep getting beaten. ""We should have scored more goals and if we'd have got three or four it would have given us more confidence. ""I picked a team to show Blackburn that we were up for a fight because they can cut you open. ""Rather than the artists who can drag their foot over the ball, I played the grafters and chasers but the substitutes impacted the game pretty well too."" Blackburn's John Eustace: ""It was great to be back, I had 15 brilliant months here. The most important thing was to not lose. That's not a good feeling but I'm fully focused on Blackburn now and I wish Birmingham all the best. ""I have no hard feelings, it's part and parcel of the job. ""If that wouldn't have happened I wouldn't have had this opportunity to be manager of Blackburn. ""I was very happy with the work I did, you could see the club grew and I left it in a much better position than when I came in. ""We were playing some really good football when I left so I was happy with the job I did."" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play.

158,Ivan Toney: Brentford boss Thomas Frank admits striker 'will probably be sold this summer',https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11748/13066020/ivan-toney-brentford-boss-thomas-frank-admits-striker-will-probably-be-sold-this-summer,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Ivan Toney ""will probably be sold this summer"", Brentford boss Thomas Frank has admitted. Toney recently returned to action after serving an eight-month ban for 232 breaches of the FA's rules for betting on football. His comeback took place amid speculation over his Brentford future, with the England international on the radar of several top clubs across Europe and the Premier League, including Chelsea, while Arsenal are also reported to be keen, but the west London club kept hold of their talisman in the January transfer window. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, interest in Toney is set to ramp up again at the end of the season and Frank has admitted the 27-year-old is likely to leave Brentford this summer ""It is relatively obvious that Ivan Toney will probably be sold this summer,"" Frank said to Danish media, via Tipsbladet. ""We also know what he is worth. I don't think there are many strikers in the world who are better than him right now. ""He is a really skilled striker who is in his prime football age. Personally, as a coach, I would prefer to keep Toney but one day it could be fun to see him on a top team. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports ""This winter we actually had no offers for him, but it will surprise me if there aren't a lot of clubs that will be interested in him."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking ahead of Brentford's weekend game with Wolves, Frank warned against reading into any mistranslations of his original Danish interview, but confirmed the possibility of Toney leaving the club either in the summer transfer window or next January. ""You always need to be aware of translation. Google translate is not always the best,"" he joked before adding: ""It's the same message I've said the whole time. ""I would love him to stay forever, but the reality is he has one year left on his contract. He's been pretty open about playing for a top club in the future, so there's a couple of scenarios. He leaves in the summer, he leaves in the winter, or he stays until the end. ""If he leaves whenever, it would be fantastic to see him for a top club."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Back in November, Sky Sports News reported Brentford valued Toney at £100m, with reports of a £50m-£60m fee meeting with derision in the club's boardroom. It reiterated Frank's valuation, with the Dane stating last summer he believed Toney to be worth £100m. Frank said: ""£100m plus?... What would you pay for a striker that guarantees you 20-plus goals? And this is 20 goals for a mid-table club. What can he do in a bigger club?"" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Toney reiterated his desire to play for a ""top club competing for trophies"" in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of his return to football last month. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He said: ""You can never predict when is the right time to move elsewhere, but I think it's obvious I want to play for a top club. ""Everybody wants to play for a top club, that is fighting for titles. Whether it's this January that is the right time for a club to come in and pay the right money, who knows? ""But my main focus is to do what I do on the pitch, and let the background work take care of itself."" On Wednesday afternoon, Brentford also confirmed Toney had been subject to racist abuse once again this season, in the wake of Monday's defeat to Manchester City. A club statement read: ""We have initiated investigations into this vile harassment which we condemn in the strongest terms. ""Sadly, this isn't the first time Ivan has had to deal with this. A similar incident occurred just four weeks ago, leading us to identify an alleged perpetrator whom we reported to the authorities. To date, we have yet to see any action taken against that individual. ""In general, the response from social media platforms to these ongoing issues has been underwhelming. Their solutions, such as filters to simply hide the abuse may safeguard the players, miss the mark entirely and do not discourage the offenders. Without real consequences for those responsible, the cycle is doomed to repeat. ""We do have faith that things can change. We appreciate the dialogue that we have with the likes of Meta but we call for more decisive and urgent action to combat online hate. We call for prompt investigations, and importantly, we call for criminal prosecutions. ""We will continue to work with the authorities and the Premier League and to support our players as we tackle this awful online abuse."" On Wednesday evening, Toney's agent Jonathan Barnett, head of ICM Stellar, released a statement condemning the racist abuse directed at the Brentford striker. It read: ""I unequivocally condemn the racist abuse our player Ivan Toney has been subjected to on social media. ""Everyone at ICM Stellar is shocked that these types of unconscionable and vile behaviours are still prevalent in society today. ""This is sadly not the first time Ivan has received racist abuse online and social media can no longer ignore a widespread and recurring problem across its platforms. ""We call on all forms of social media to do more to prevent, address and combat unacceptable and distressing incidents of discrimination such as this. ""My team will conduct an investigation and pass on any findings to the appropriate authorities - we will not just be bystanders. ""Some time ago I personally instituted a diversity and inclusivity department at our agency and headed by Pokuaa Ansere, we have taken considerable action against all forms of discrimination. ""We continue this fight and will never give in to prejudice, intolerance or hate. ""We now call upon all clubs, institutions, fellow agencies and governing bodies to join us and send out a clear message that we stand united against racist, discriminatory or unacceptable levels of abuse. ""I personally stand with Ivan, his family and friends, as well as anyone else who has been subjected to discrimination. ""We implore the football world to kick it out - once and for all.""

160,Scottish Women's Premier League round-up: Rangers remain six clear of Celtic in title race,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13066611/scottish-womens-premier-league-round-up-rangers-remain-six-clear-of-celtic-in-title-race,Author not found,Publish time not found,"A round-up from the Scottish Women's Premier League as leaders Rangers beat Hearts to remain six points clear of Celtic, who won at Motherwell. Rangers 1 - 0 Hearts Rangers overcame Hearts as the Gers battled for three points in Cumbernauld. Few chances separated the sides in the opening minutes but that changed thanks to Jane Ross. Rachel Rowe picked out Ross in the Hearts area, and the forward found the back of the net for the only goal of the game. The home side would've hoped for more goals but will be happy with the win that keeps them securely at the top of the table and six points clear of Celtic. Rangers will hope to remain unbeaten on Sunday when they visit Petershill Park to take on Partick Thistle while Hearts host Aberdeen on the same day. Motherwell 0 - 2 Celtic Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Live football on Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments It was a job well done for Elena Sadiku's side as Celtic picked up a vital three points in the title race with a 2-0 victory over Motherwell at K Park. Caitlin Hayes broke the deadlock with 27 minutes played as the defender nodded a Celtic corner past the goalkeeper. With eight minutes left to play, Amy Gallacher doubled the Celts' advantage as she struck a Paula Partido cross into the back of the net. Celtic visit the capital next as they take on Hibernian on Sunday. Motherwell are in Lanarkshire derby action with a trip to face Hamilton Accies. Aberdeen 2 - 1 Montrose Aberdeen came from behind to beat Montrose 2-1 in a thrilling encounter in the ScottishPower Women's Premier League. The visitors opened the scoring as Holly Daniel put her side up a few minutes into the second half. Montrose fashioned another chance on the hour mark as Neve Guthrie found herself through on goal. She could only fire wide - a miss that the visitors would soon regret. With 73 minutes gone, Eilidh Shore found the equaliser for Aberdeen as she rose above the rest to head in off the woodwork. The game entered the closing stages and with three minutes left on the clock, Francesca Ogilvie worked her way inside the box and fired into the far side of goal, beating the goalkeeper. The late strike proved to be the winner as the home side claimed all three points and moved six points clear in 7th. Aberdeen will be hoping for back-to-back victories on Sunday when they travel away to take on Hearts. Montrose will hope to cause a shock as they host reigning league champions Glasgow City. Spartans 0 - 1 Partick Thistle Partick Thistle made it three league wins in a row with a narrow 1-0 victory over Spartans. No goals separated the sides in the first half but Carla Boyce fired Thistle in front with 57 minutes on the clock. The striker headed in from Amy Bulloch's free-kick to make it two goals in two games since joining Thistle in January. The result pushes the Jags up to 5th in the table, three points clear of Hearts, while Spartans remain in the relegation play-off spot. A difficult tie up next for Thistle as they host Rangers on Sunday while Spartans are away from home to face relegation rivals Dundee United. Glasgow City 6 - 0 Hamilton Accies One goal in the first half and five in the second gave Glasgow City a comfortable win over Hamilton Accies as the visitors remain rooted to the bottom of the SWPL table. With just over half an hour gone, Emily Whelan got on the end of a cross from Lauren Davidson and struck home the opener. They took the lead going into half-time, but they would show off their attacking prowess in the second half. Scorer of the opener, Whelan, crossed into the box and found Aleigh Gambone. The American found the back of the net for City's second. Brilliant play from Lisa Forrest set up Whelan for another goal and she made no mistake in slotting it past the goalkeeper. Lauren Davidson added her name to the scoresheet 10 minutes later as her pinpoint strike left the goalkeeper with no chance. After being on the pitch for mere seconds, Wilma Forsblom added to City's lead as the new signing hit the ground running in Glasgow. Rounding off a fantastic performance for the reigning SWPL champions, Cori Sullivan found the net from a free-kick shortly before the final whistle. Glasgow City have a trip to Montrose on Sunday as they take on the 11th-placed side in what they will hope to make a dominant away day.

161,"Jones Knows best bets: Palace to avoid defeat, Luton corners and Bramall Lane cards forms 6/1 weekend treble",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13061849/jones-knows-best-bets-palace-to-avoid-defeat-luton-corners-and-bramall-lane-cards-forms-6-1-weekend-treble,Lewis Jones,Publish time not found,"After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble. Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost. I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore. Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down. Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter. We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down. This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress. Download the Sky Sports App Watch Premier League highlights Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi. Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet. Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa. Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet. To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more. Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.

162,Coventry City 2-1 Millwall: Haji Wright scores twice to send Sky Blues back into Championship play-off places,https://www.skysports.com/football/coventry-vs-millwall/report/485064,Dan Long,Publish time not found,"Coventry got back to winning ways and returned to the Championship play-off places after coming from behind to beat Millwall 2-1. The Sky Blues' impressive 10-match unbeaten run had been ended by Norwich eight days earlier and the threat of a second defeat in succession lingered for more than an hour after 18-year-old Romain Esse had slammed home for Millwall on only his second league start of the season. But, in the space of three second-half minutes, Haji Wright coolly rolled in a penalty and then beat Lions goalkeeper Matija Sarkic at his near post to turn the game in the Coventry's favour. They move level on points with, but also above of, Sunderland into sixth in the table with 15 games to play, while Millwall stay 18th, with a gap of only four points between themselves and the relegation zone. There was a high tempo at the CBS from the first whistle. Millwall's George Honeyman forced an important save from Brad Collins inside 35 seconds, while at the other end, Wright's shot somehow hit the post twice before being cleared. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Twelve minutes in, the Lions - without a win since New Year's Day - threw the formbook out of the window. Zian Flemming drove into the box off the left flank and, fortuitously, managed to roll the ball along the floor for Esse to bury the opener The visitors had chances to make it 2-0 as Michael Obafemi connected with Danny McNamara's pull-back, but failed to make Collins work, and Joe Bryan chested down a poor delivery and arrowed his shot past the right-hand post. How Coventry and Millwall lined up Match stats Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports on Whatsapp! Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Coventry had their fair share of openings, too. Victor Torp's dipping free-kick was tipped over by Sarkic and Wright guided a Milan van Ewijk cross over the bar, before Kasey Palmer's shot, which looked destined for the top-left corner, was blocked by the head of Wes Harding. By the hour mark, there was no real sign of Millwall's lead being cancelled out, or extended, for that matter. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That all changed when the hosts were awarded a penalty after Spurs loanee Japhet Tanganga's clumsy tackle on Wright, who rolled home to equalise with 23 minutes to play. And the in-form American - who scored just twice in his first 15 games since a summer move from Danish club Sonderjyske - took his tally to five in his last seven by latching onto Callum O'Hare's pass and tucking a shot past Sarkic, which won the game. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Coventry manager Mark Robins joked he was ""going to kill"" Wright and O'Hare over their unconventional way of deciding who would take a penalty in their 2-1 victory over Millwall. Wright won an impromptu game of rock paper scissors between the two, before converting the spot-kick. ""Rock paper scissors? I'm going to kill them,"" said Robins. ""For me, it's about who's confident to take the penalty. ""Now, Callum's confident, Haji was a regular penalty taker in Turkey (with Antalyaspor), so I've got no problem and then if I get involved with that then it obviously puts doubt in somebody's head. ""So, let them sort it out and if they miss it then they're in trouble, aren't they, but thankfully they've got the wherewithal and the calm heads to deal with that situation. ""The good thing is they both want to score, they both want to take the penalty, they both want to get on the scoresheet. ""I think that, obviously, you've got a situation where there's two really decent penalty takers there, but it needs to be a little bit more scientific than that. ""They've obviously sorted it out between themselves and that's fine."" Millwall's Joe Edwards: ""It's a really frustrating position that we're in at the moment because you constantly have games like this where there's a lot to be pleased with. ""We start well, we execute a lot of what we talk about and, it's been more so in our home games, today we get the goal that our start deserves then have an opportunity to get the second. ""That makes it a completely different game, not only for them but it also it relieves the constant stress the defensive part of your team has to live with when you're facing the likes of the attacking players they've got. ""The problem for us is as a group, those of us who live it every day - that's players, staff and fans - it's been a bit of a recurring theme. ""There's too many points getting away from us at the moment, and it's frustrating."" Both teams are back in action on Wednesday February 14. At 7.45pm, Coventry face Plymouth at Home Park, while slightly later at 8pm, Millwall host Ipswich at The Den. Both matches will be available to watch live on Sky Sports Football Red Button.

The former Livingston and Aberdeen player only lasted 79 days in the job, overseeing 12 games, with former player Don Cowie now taking interim charge. County have lost seven of their previous nine matches, only collecting two points in that run, and are 11th in the league -the same position they found themselves in when Adams was appointed for a third time in November. In a club statement published on Wednesday evening, a day after County were thrashed 5-0 by Motherwell, Adams said: ""After much consideration in recent weeks, I have made the decision to resign from my position. ""Over my 12 league games in charge, we moved six points clear of the team directly below and have been extremely close to gaining more victories and draws along the way. ""Ross County Football Club is close to my heart after twice playing here and managing for a third time.""

Ross County fixtures Ross County stats Scottish Prem table Adams secured seven points from his first three games in charge but the Dingwall side have only collected two points from a possible 24 since and exited the Scottish Gas Scottish Cup with a 3-0 home defeat against Partick Thistle. Adams claimed his former club Morecambe were 100 times better than County after losing a late winning goal against Dundee in his fifth match in charge and launched a scathing attack on the ""shocking"" standard of Scottish football. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The former Plymouth and Bradford manager then hinted after the cup defeat by Thistle that he would have had second thoughts about taking the job for a third time had he done more homework. Adams signed seven players in January but the reshaping of his squad did not have any immediate positive effect and he was hit by long-term injuries to the likes of defenders Jack Baldwin and Connor Randall. County will now look for a solution ahead of their next game against Rangers at Ibrox on February 14 with the backroom staff remaining in position. Speaking to Sky Sports Neil Lennon, James McFadden and Kris Boyd reflected on the decision. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neil Lennon: ""Maybe he's done Ross County a favour, giving them time to get someone else in to maybe see it through until the end of the season. He's never looked happy. Some of his interviews after games were, quite frankly, shocking. It wouldn't have helped the morale in the dressing room."" Kris Boyd: ""I think it's obvious to see why it hasn't worked out. You can't go and lambast your players in every interview and then expect them to perform for you every weekend. You might be the best coach in the world, you can galvanise players behind closed doors, but if you're having a go at them in public they'll switch off."" James McFadden: ""I'm not really surprised.

166,"Rangers 3-0 Livingston: Fabio Silva, Rabbi Matondo and Todd Cantwell score as Gers cut Celtic's lead at top of Scottish Premiership table",https://www.skysports.com/football/rangers-vs-livingston/report/487733,Sam Blitz,Publish time not found,"Rangers thumped Livingston 3-0 to cut Celtic's lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership to just three points with a game in hand. Buoyed by Celtic dropping points at Aberdeen earlier in the day, Rangers dominated the game with late first-half goals from Fabio Silva - his first in Gers colours - and Rabbi Matondo putting them in cruise control. Todd Cantwell made it three after half-time, sweeping home in a great team move as Philippe Clement's side also moved two goals behind Celtic in the goal difference battle. Asked about the title race after the game, Clement told Sky Sports: ""Where are we, little bit more than half way? It's a long way to do. Before the last two or three games of the season, it's not important."" The match was a complete mismatch, with Livingston ending the game with no shots on goal and just two touches in the Rangers penalty box. Rangers started on the front foot immediately, with Clement's side looking to close the points and goal difference gap on Celtic. Ryan Jack cracked an early effort from the edge of the box which was well-saved by Shamal George, who was then equal to James Tavenier's corner, which had to be clawed from underneath his own bar. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Ross McCausland, Cantwell, Tavernier and Matondo all had efforts from the edge of the box fly wide, as Rangers generated 17 first-half shots with nearly 78 per cent of the ball. Rangers stepped it up a gear towards the end of the half as Matondo had a deflected shot tipped over by George. But then the opener came from the resulting corner. Barisic's corner was poked goalwards by Conor Goldson but it was blocked into the path of Silva, who hooked the ball into the bottom corner. VAR took a look at a potential high boot on David Carson by Goldson in the build-up, but waved any Livingston complaints away. Moments later, it was two as Barisic fed Matondo to the left of the box and this time, a deflection on his shot took the ball into the bottom corner. It was three just 10 minutes after half-time as McCausland burst down the right and found the unmarked Cantwell in the box, who lifted the ball above George into the middle of the net. From that point on, Rangers could afford to be wasteful. McCausland forced two more saves from George, while Silva's acrobatic effort fell just wide of the far post. Substitute Cyriel Dessers was denied a goal in a third straight game as he put a close-range effort over the bar, while fellow replacement Ridvan Yilmaz struck the bar. It was a game where Rangers didn't need to get out of second gear. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rangers manager Philippe Clement to Sky Sports: ""I'm very satisfied. You see the team growing week by week, month by month, becoming stronger. Like you saw today, when you make changes you don't see a drop of level. ""It was a really good evening. The fans liked it, the football they see now, we are getting closer and closer to the football we want to see. ""It's important for everybody. I don't think about signings, or people long or short in the building. The new players need to adapt with and without the ball. ""Fabio is getting better and better.

It is an evening we are satisfied about and we want to have more evenings like this. ""We are still ambitious in three competitions.

I think there's a handball in there around the back but I don't have any issues with that. But there's a foul in the build-up. ""That first goal changes the dynamic of the game and if it doesn't stand, we don't concede the second in the way we do. ""Because at the start of the game, Rangers are back in the title race. The crowd is up because Celtic dropped two points. That impacted the first 20 minutes, but my players did well. They stayed in their structure, stayed in their shape and they matched what Rangers came with us in. ""Then the corner comes in and then there's a foul on Dave Carson. I don't think it's the referee's fault, I think it's the people in the VAR room. He's flying in with high feet, it has an impact on David because he sees him flying in. That impacts David's ability to attack the space and clear the ball. ""The first 35 minutes is huge away at Rangers or Parkhead. But if we don't concede that first goal, then we go in on level terms and then you have no idea how the second half goes. But the momentum really flipped at that point. ""I would love teams in and around us to not pick up points. We will be here until matchday 38 and keep fighting. The harsh reality is we need to start picking up points as quickly as possible.""

Chelsea boss Hayes - who will leave the club at the end of the season after 12 years - has won January's WSL Manager of the Month award having overseen three league wins since the winter break. Two of those came in January, with the Blues having scored three goals in each fixture and conceded just once against Manchester United. This has all come without Chelsea's star striker Sam Kerr, who snapped her ACL during the Blues' Morocco training camp. It would not have had a bearing on the WSL award, but Hayes also secured Chelsea top spot in their Champions League group as they aim to win the European trophy for the first time. They will face Ajax in the quarter-finals. Chelsea also booked their spot in the FA Cup fifth round win a win against West Ham in extra-time. They will face Crystal Palace for a spot in the quarter-finals of the competition. It is a double win for Chelsea too as James has been named WSL Player of the Month for January.

169,Newcastle 4-4 Luton: Harvey Barnes' comeback goal caps thriller as fearless Hatters hold on for draw,https://www.skysports.com/football/newcastle-vs-luton/report/482819,Nick Wright,Publish time not found,"Luton held off a late Newcastle fightback to claim a 4-4 draw in an extraordinary game at St James' Park. Eddie Howe's side were left stunned after the visitors twice cancelled out Sean Longstaff goals through Gabriel Osho and Ross Barkley in the first half, with a Carlton Morris penalty and an Elijah Adebayo strike then putting them 4-2 up in the second period. But Newcastle hauled themselves level when substitute Harvey Barnes found the bottom corner on his first appearance since September after Kieran Trippier had dispatched a sumptuous cross from Bruno Guimaraes for their third goal. The hosts poured forward in search of a winner in the closing stages, with Jacob Murphy spurning a big chance from another Guimaraes cross, but their fearless opponents, 4-0 winners over Brighton on Tuesday, continued to carry a threat of their own as a wild game remained open until the last. The result puts Newcastle's defensive struggles into sharp focus once more and ensures they miss the chance to make up ground on the top six. For 16th-placed Luton, meanwhile, it is another invaluable point which further boosts their hopes of survival. Newcastle: Dubravka (5), Trippier (8), Schar (6), Botman (6), Burn (4), Bruno (8), Longstaff (8), Miley (7), Murphy (6), Almiron (5), Gordon (7).


Subs: Wilson (6), Barnes (8), Livramento (7).


Luton: Kaminski (5), Bell (6), Mengi (6), Osho (7), Doughty (7), Lokonga (8), Barkley (9), Ogbene (8), Clark (7), Morris (8), Adebayo (8).


Subs: Mpanzu (6), Brown (6), Burke (6), Woodrow (6).


Player of the match: Ross Barkley The game was a manic affair from the start, with Longstaff firing Newcastle's seventh-minute opener after a superb diagonal pass from Lewis Miley released Trippier for the cut-back. Chiedozie Ogbene's speed and trickery was causing problems for the hosts at the other end, but it was their prodigious set-piece threat which led to their first goal, Osho nodding home after Morris had headed a Barkley free-kick into the six-yard box. Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App It was Luton's 10th set-piece goal of the season - the third-highest total by any Premier League side - but Newcastle mustered an immediate response following a counter-attack as Thomas Kaminski palmed Anthony Gordon's shot out to Longstaff, who took a touch and fired another clinical finish into the corner. Newcastle had chances to extend their lead, with Gordon seeing a shot blocked when well-placed to score in the box, but Luton continued to throw bodies forward and soon got their reward. Their second goal was scored and created by Barkley as he drove through midfield and fed Alfie Doughty, whose cross-shot was parried back into his path by Martin Dubravka for a simple finish. Newcastle's Anthony Gordon had to be taken off for Callum Wilson at half-time and later left the stadium in a protective boot.


Eddie Howe said: ""I think he twisted his ankle. He is in a protective boot and the physios are doing the right thing."" Newcastle started the second half positively but Luton's directness continued to trouble them, with Dan Burn's inability to contain Ogbene proving costly as he was penalised for pulling the winger back just inside the Newcastle box following a VAR check. Morris was made to retake his penalty after scoring with his first effort when the referee had not signalled his readiness, but kept his cool at the second attempt, again sending Dubravka the wrong way, to put Luton ahead for the first time. It was no less than Rob Edwards' side deserved and their fans were in dreamland soon afterwards when, from another slick break, Barkley teed up Adebayo for an emphatic diagonal finish. Newcastle were stunned but managed to regain their composure, thanks in part to Guimaraes, whose brilliant, outside-of-the-boot cross allowed Trippier to reduce the deficit at the far post. Then, when substitute Barnes marked his return from injury with a wonderful finish into the corner from outside the box, it appeared the hosts were in position to go on and win it. They had chances to do so, most notably when Murphy fired over from another Guimaraes delivery struck using the outside of his boot, but Luton held on and could have claimed the win themselves in the dying moments of the 10 minutes of stoppage time. Barkley, excellent again in Luton's midfield, was the creator of the chance as his pass released Ogbene on the right-hand side of the Newcastle box, but his powerful shot was too close to Dubravka, ensuring the spoils were shared. Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson said: ""Amazing. A great advert for the Premier League. End-to-end, both teams wanted to win the game and both teams were willing to keep themselves bare at the back to score goals. It was an amazing football match, so credit to both managers and both sets of players. ""I thought Eddie got it wrong with Burn. He was getting ripped to shreds down Newcastle's left. He should have brought him off earlier for Tino Livramento. Ogbene just had him on toast and that's where it was all coming from. ""Luton were fearless. They've scored four and four in the last two games. Barkley lost the ball for one of the goals, but again he was outstanding. ""What I like about Luton is they have come up and they have played like they did in the Championship. ""The two up front are a handful. Ogbene down the right, Doughty down the left. The defenders are willing to defend. ""I can't talk highly enough of them. I think they've been absolutely amazing so far. ""It's about confidence. In the games they lost at home at the start, against some of the big boys, they faded quite quickly, they were getting tired. ""The problem when you come up is that you have to apply top gear week in, week out. It takes a toll when you're not getting results. Now, they are getting results. When that happens, you don't get as tired. A long, long way to go but what they have done has been incredible."" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe: ""It was a strange game really. So much to look back on and reflect on. We are disappointed to have not grown stronger in the game. Credit to Luton on how they got back into the game. And then we had to do that as well. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""The first goal is a set play and another is a penalty. We made some poor decisions defensively. When we went 1-0 up and I don't think we handled it well until they equalised. ""I wanted us to grab control of the game but we didn't. That's the frustrating thing. In that moment we had a lack of confidence and then a real credit to the players for coming back because it is not easy to do. We scored some great goals and could have won it."" Luton boss Rob Edwards said: ""It is very mixed. I am very proud and pleased with the performance. We were brave. ""They came back quickly and the way we stayed composed and didn't go under was pleasing. That could have happened in this cauldron of an atmosphere. We even had a chance to win it at the end. It was an even game, and a great game."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On their style of play, he added: ""I have said to the players, this is the best way for us to get results. The players have really bought in. ""We have been this way before, but it suits who we are and what we are. It suits the whole football club to be honest. It gives us more threat and upsets the flow of the opposition."" He added: ""I think when you look at their goals there were some things we could have done. You just need to see certain moments out. Some of the actions for their goals we could have done better on. ""They will be thinking the same as well. There are always areas to improve. We are human beings and we make mistakes and we will always make mistakes."" Luton captain Carlton Morris said: ""We are a little bit disappointed to be 4-2 up and come away with a point. We showed a lot of character to stay in the game. It isn't an easy place to come and when they have their tails up, they are deadly. ""It can be tough at times but there is a lot of quality in this league. It is clear that we have evolved a lot from the start of the season to now and we are showing that pedigree. Hopefully we can score four goals every week. ""We want to be a fun team to watch as well. We do want to be exciting and play flowing football. That's what we are doing. We are learning and getting better every week. We continue to build so it's great."" Newcastle face Nottingham Forest at the City Ground next Saturday, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 5.30pm.

The 75-year-old returns to professional football once again after leaving Huddersfield in September, with the Dons his 17th different club in British football - but his first in Scotland. Warnock replaces Barry Robson, who after a year in charge as caretaker then permanent boss, was sacked following a 1-1 draw at home to Dundee last week, which left the club eighth in the Scottish Premiership. First-team coach Peter Leven, who oversaw the side's 1-1 draw with Celtic at Pittodrie on Saturday, will remain in his role, with Ronnie Jespon joining Warnock as assistant ahead of his first game in charge at Rangers on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports. Warnock's recent spell at Huddersfield was his second at the club and he has spent time in charge of the likes of Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City in a managerial career that has spanned more than 40 years. He announced his retirement from football in 2022 before taking over at Huddersfield and now extends his career even further in the Granite City.

""When you get to my age you think twice, I've had that many retirements, but when I spoke to Dave Cormack and Alan [Burrows] it just seemed the right thing to do. It gives them a little bit of time to look for the right manager to take the club forward and, as I said to them, let's have a little bit of fun between now and the end of the season. I like to put smiles on people's faces. ""It's not for the money, I've had some good offers in the last six or eight weeks, but I'd like to have a go in this league and I'd like to have a go with a club like this. ""Yes, I can't change the squad because the window's closed now. It probably is a little bit light in certain areas but I'm not going to worry about that. It's just do what I can do with what we've got and try and enjoy it. ""I was going to start next week but the lure of taking over for a game like tomorrow night is too good."" Chairman Dave Cormack added: ""From the moment we first spoke with Neil his enthusiasm for managing Aberdeen was infectious. ""He has had an incredible career in management, not only in terms of volume of games and winning promotions, but also of coming into clubs at short notice and making an immediate impact. ""We look forward to Neil, Ronnie and the team pushing hard in the remaining four months of the campaign as we still have a huge amount to play for both in the SPFL Premiership and the Scottish Cup."" Aberdeen confirmed in a statement the appointment of Warnock will give time to complete a detailed review of the football operation which began at the end of last year. That process will then inform and support the process of selecting and appointing a new management team ahead of the 2024/25 season. Cormack said: ""Ambitious clubs regularly invest in independent advice to support internal coaching, data analysis, recruitment, and medical teams with the goal of improving performance through continuous learning and development. ""The highly experienced team of independent advisors, who do this work with some of the best clubs across the globe, will make recommendations to allow us to understand what we can improve upon in terms of best practice going forward. ""The review will include benchmarking the club against similar teams that currently outperform us in Europe.

""I asked Laurent D'Jaffo, one of my ex-players who was at Aberdeen, what it was like up there and he said 'Gaffer, it is the only place the seagulls never land - it's the coldest place on earth.' ""But I never got a reply to Aberdeen but you just don't know what's around the corner. I'm fascinated with challenges now."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of Aberdeen's draw with Celtic on Saturday, Kris Boyd was critical of the Dons' decision to appoint an interim manager - hitting out at owner Dave Cormack for not creating a succession plan after Robson's sacking.

Aberdeen, from where they are at this moment in time in the league, is an absolute disgrace. You can blame Europe but there are other games as well. ""Aberdeen, as a football club, need to get a grip of this situation. If you look at Dave Cormack, he wants to control everything. He has every right, he's the owner of the football club. ""But there have been three managers sacked in the end of January and the beginning of February under Dave Cormack. Two heads of recruitment have been sacked.

173,Ipswich Town 2-2 West Brom: Omari Hutchinson rescues dramatic point for Kieran McKenna's Tractor Boys,https://www.skysports.com/football/ipswich-vs-w-brom/report/485066,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Omari Hutchinson struck deep into second-half stoppage time to salvage a point for Ipswich and a 2-2 draw against West Brom on Saturday afternoon. Kieran McKenna's side had won just one of their previous eight league games prior to the Baggies' visit to Portman Road and fell behind after 18 minutes when Tom Fellows drifted in off the left and beat Vaclav Hladky at his near post. A Town equaliser before the break seemed inevitable and it came within the first 60 seconds of the second half, as Nathan Broadhead guided a shot in after George Edmundson had flicked a header into his path. Andi Weimann then had a 'Hand of God' style goal ruled out, but the visitors did take the lead when John Swift thumped in from 25 yards, shortly after Daryl Dike had been withdrawn after a serious-looking ankle injury. However, Hutchinson popped up when he was needed most to rifle a low shot home after West Brom had failed to clear their lines from a corner. The teams stay fourth and fifth respectively in the Championship table. The visitors were dominating proceedings in the opening few minutes and Jed Wallace's teasing low cross just evaded the stretching Brandon Thomas-Asante on the edge of the six-yard box. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Weimann was found in space on the edge of the area following a corner by Wallace but his shot sailed over the crossbar. Albion took a well-deserved lead in the 18th minute through Fellows following a counter attack. He was found out on the left by Weimann and Fellows outmuscled Luke Woolfenden, cut inside and fired a shot past Town goalkeeper Vaclav Hladky. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ipswich had a wonderful chance to equalise five minutes later when a cross from Broadhead found Bournemouth loanee Kieffer Moore, who laid the ball off for Conor Chaplin, but he could only lift it over the crossbar. With time running out in the first half, Harry Clarke's thunderous effort from 20 yards was tipped over by visiting goalkeeper Alex Palmer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Tractor Boys struck back straight from the restart following a deep throw-in by Clarke. The ball was deflected off George Edmundson's head into the path of Broadhead, who volleyed past Palmer to make it 1-1. A rasping shot from Sam Morsy from fully 30 yards out went sailing over the bar and - moments later - West Brom had the ball in the net from a throw-in but Weimann was booked for putting it past Hladky's outstretched hand. Chaplin stung the hands of Palmer following a great move involving Broadhead, Morsy, Clarke and Wes Burns, with the latter cutting the ball back to the striker as the hosts started to dominate proceedings. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Substitute Swift scored for West Brom with a stunning shot from nearly 30 yards out in the 76th minute after Edmundson's pass out from defence was intercepted and he picked out the bottom left-hand corner of the net. But Hutchinson levelled matters in stoppage time - after Morsy's shot was blocked - as he fired home to clinch a point. Ipswich came close to gaining maximum points during a frenetic eight minutes of added-on time when Albion goalkeeper Palmer blocked a shot from Ali Al-Hamadi from point-blank range. Ipswich's Kieran McKenna: ""I thought it was a really good game, great atmosphere, bar from a couple of inches from the end, we would have been talking about an absolute classic in terms of games we've had at this stadium. ""Lots of good things about the performance. I thought we deserved the three points to be honest. Lots of good things about the performance, on the ball, also off the ball, plenty of good things. ""Two moments that we did not defend well enough that leads to frustration that we haven't won the game and another game that we feel like we've done enough to win the game. ""A lot of pride in the way we played, the effort given, the atmosphere the supporters created and stuck with and going behind twice to West Brom to put the pressure on that we did to get a point…we can take a lot from that. ""In plenty of games we have had better opportunities, better chances and more of them and not given too much away and that's always frustrating when we don't get the wins, but it's always much more concerning when you're not giving away chances, that's not been the case. ""You have spells in the season when we were extremely clinical and made some big interventions at the other end as well so you usually hope and trust your performances are consistent and you are creating more than you are giving away, you'll pick up plenty of points. ""They (West Brom) are a really fit team who work hard. The energy levels we had at the end, the impact of the substitutes - that's something that we can take big positives from."" West Brom's Carlos Corberan: ""We scored a goal after we started to make more passes and we started to make them suffer more. ""If you leave too much and give a goal to them, it's very difficult to win the game. ""We put a lot of energy and a lot of effort in to try and win the game. ""Everyone is affected when you see an injury. I think the injury of Bartley has affected the rest of the team. ""He was fantastic in the middle of the pitch but I understand that with the skill in the set-pieces, he was the best. ""We were stable in the first half and it was something we tried to fix for the second half but before we started the game (again), they scored a goal in the second phase of one throw-in and again, they scored a goal again in the second phase of another throw-in. It's off another set-piece. ""But I think the team showed some positives in the second half. We attacked but we did not attack enough.""

178,"Aleksander Ceferin will not run for UEFA presidency in 2027, hits out at 'nonsense projects' and ex-chief of football",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13066754/aleksander-ceferin-will-not-run-for-uefa-presidency-in-2027,Ron Walker,Publish time not found,"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin hit out at his critics and ""nonsense projects of so-called super leagues"" as he announced he would not run for a fourth term in 2027. Ceferin revealed he would step down at the end of his current presidency only minutes after a UEFA Congress vote had given him the chance to stand for a fourth time in 2027 - as he did not serve the full length of his first term, when he took over after Michel Platini was forced to resign in 2016. The head of UEFA came to power eight years ago on a platform of reform, and himself introduced measures limiting senior executives to serving a maximum of three terms in their roles. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That led to criticism in recent months as speculation rose he was intending to run again, but speaking on Thursday, the 56-year-old said he had made the decision to stand down last summer due to the time he was spending away from his family. He said he had kept the news private - and allowed the vote to proceed - as he ""wanted to see the real face of some people"", in a speech where he also took aim at former UEFA chief of football Zvonimir Boban without explicitly naming him. Boban resigned his position on January 25 in protest at what he described as ongoing plans for the current president to serve a fourth term, and in an open letter published in the Croatian press labelled them ""disastrous"". Addressing the continent's media following the vote, Ceferin said: ""I could legally run until 2031, the congress decided to vote in the change and that's how serious organisations work. ""The statutes had to be changed or term limits would not exist at all. I am a lawyer, and articles were written about me - it was strange that I didn't get any questions. ""Factually, it's my decision if I want to run after 2027. Honestly speaking, I am tired of Covid, tired of two wars, nonsense projects of so-called super leagues and self-proclaimed moral authorities who are only moral until it comes to their personal interest. ""My family knew it first, and then I told just some of my friends and colleagues. I intentionally did not want to disclose my thoughts for two reasons. First, I wanted to see the real face of some people - and I saw it. I saw good and bad parts. ""And, of course, I didn't want to influence the congress. I wanted them to decide, not knowing what I'm telling you today, because that's an honest decision. ""Now, just two sentences about the self-proclaimed moral authority. The person you know I am speaking about, does not deserve a comment from my side. But people who know him and me will make their own opinion. ""Just one thing about his pathetic cry about morality. He was one of the people who knew I was planning not to run in 2027. The moment he had the information I would disclose this after congress, he went out with his narcissistic letter. ""He could not wait because after my disclosure, his whining would not make sense any more. Now think - whose personal aspirations are in question, and whose morality is in question?"" Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: ""It's not entirely a surprise. He had never come out and said he would definitely stand again in 2027. A lot of people were saying he was very tired, he'd been saying in interviews he was tired - so there was the possibility he might walk away in 2027. ""Ceferin has been working behind the scenes over the last few months to change the rules at UEFA so he wouldn't have to leave in 2027, he could stay in post for an extra four years to 2031. ""He achieved that this morning, he had the rules changed. But less than an hour later, he comes out and says he's leaving even through the rules have changed - and what's more, he made the decision six months ago. ""If he knew he was leaving, why has he gone to the whole trouble of changing the rules? It sounded like he thinks he's a character in The Godfather or a mafia movie. ""He turned round and said he wanted to see who his real friends are, because everyone over the last few months has been writing articles and saying things about him wanting to change the rules to stay for another four years. ""He could have just come out and said everything being written was rubbish, and that he didn't want to stay. He's saying he didn't do that because he was sitting back, reading all these articles, listening to all these peoples - and seeing the people who were writing these things, talking about things in public, weren't his friends. ""It's very curious, but Ceferin is an emotional person. We want people to be honest and open in news conferences, and that's what he was. He said he was fed up and tired. ""It was box office, well worth watching - we don't normally get these kind of news conferences in the football world.""

179,Kylian Mbappe's future: The inner circle who will help him decide where to go next after revealing he'll leave Paris St-Germain,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13064810/kylian-mbappes-future-real-madrid-or-psg-the-inner-circle-who-will-help-make-his-decision,Melissa Reddy,Publish time not found,"Kylian Mbappe will leave Paris St-Germain this summer - but who are the key figures in his camp who will help him decide his next move? Mbappe, out of contract in the summer, communicated his decision to Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the PSG president, on Tuesday that he will be moving on. PSG expect his next destination to be Real Madrid. Here we take a look at Team Mbappe, the tiny inner circle who help sketch the career of one of the world's best talents... While senior officials at Real Madrid call his mother 'La jefa' - the boss - she maintains she works for her son and that ""he is in charge."" The 25-year-old takes direction and advice from his brains trust, but all sources are aligned in saying nothing happens without his approval. In fact, when PSG had banished the French captain to the ""loft"" - the squad without a first-team future - he took it upon himself to remedy the situation. Kylian held direct talks with Al-Khelaifi without assistance from his entourage. Former coaches say that even before he was a teenager, the attacker was taking control of his destiny by diligently doing Spanish and English lessons at school, even holding mock press conferences to practice being a professional footballer. Mbappe's mother is a former handball player and exacting negotiator. She is viewed as the most significant member of the team and, as one former Premier League sporting director already called her five years ago, ""the one you need to get onside"" to have any shot of signing Mbappe.

180,David Moyes' future at West Ham: For some supporters this is about much more than results - style issues remain,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/37587/13071385/david-moyes-future-at-west-ham-for-some-supporters-this-is-about-much-more-than-results-style-issues-remain,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"West Ham's 6-0 defeat to Arsenal sparked an outpouring of frustration that had been building towards David Moyes for some time. Maybe it had always been there, in truth. But for some supporters, this felt like the end. Enough was enough. Any six-goal thrashing would heighten the emotions. But the wider discontent towards a manager who ended the club's 58-year wait for a European trophy in May is confusing for many on the outside. West Ham are eighth in the Premier League table, after all. ""Let us be fair,"" said Moyes in the wake of the defeat. ""Over the last three years it has been the best time West Ham have ever had. Sixth and seventh in the league, semi-final of the Europa League, a final of a European cup competition and I still think this club has grown."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He has a point and there have been plenty willing to make it for him. Take a step back and West Ham are no crisis club. The silverware that was craved has been delivered and they remain above supposedly more upwardly-mobile clubs in the Premier League table. But while it is easy to tell West Ham supporters to be careful what they wish for, it is surely more interesting to ask why it is that they wish for it. What is it about the football, what is it about Moyes, that is not generating the hope or excitement of elsewhere? The style question has dogged Moyes. Words like cautious and negative have become staples of phone-ins and forums. Not expansive enough. Not ambitious enough. But what does this mean? A look at the underlying numbers provides some insight. There are statistics that suggest West Ham do things differently to other teams - and very differently to other teams with their budget and aspirations. Moyes' team do not press as much as the rest. Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Download the Sky Sports app Read more football features Opta defines a pressed sequence as a passage of play starting in the opposition's defensive third where that team makes three or fewer passes and the sequence ends in their own half. West Ham have the fewest in the Premier League. Liverpool have the most. The PPDA numbers tell a similar story. These calculate the number of opposition passes allowed per defensive action, essentially measuring how passive a team is when out of possession. Only Nottingham Forest allow more. Liverpool allow the fewest. The result is that West Ham rarely turn the ball over high up the pitch. Those moments that can be such a source of excitement, winning possession around the opposition box, are rare under Moyes. Only bottom club Sheffield United have fewer high turnovers. The final measure worth mentioning, another that illustrates how West Ham play on the back foot, is the one that shows how much progress upfield that the opposition make against each Premier League team per sequences of play. West Ham are top again. This particular metric has Roberto De Zerbi's Brighton at the opposite end of the scale and that contrast strikes at the heart of the style question. The teams are separated by only a point - in West Ham's favour - and have similar ambitions, domestic and European. But there is a reason why they are perceived so differently and it is wrong to attempt to explain that away as a mere desire for the exotic. It is rooted in this issue of style. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Clearly, there are times when it works for West Ham. Notably, Moyes took his team to Brighton and won in August, needing only 22 per cent of possession to beat De Zerbi's side. No team this season has had so little of the ball and won a Premier League game. In fact, it is one of seven matches that have been won by teams with fewer than 26 per cent of the ball in the Premier League so far this season. West Ham are responsible for four of them. They are the masters of the smash and grab, experts at winning without the ball. It is unique across Europe's five major leagues to have success playing this way. Only six of the 96 teams have had less possession than West Ham. All six rank 15th or lower in their respective tables. The correlation between possession and position is real. That becomes a real problem for Moyes when his team goes on a run of seven games without a win in all competitions. If teams play in a way that is similar to successful teams, supporters can still see the way forward. It can sustain them through a slump. When West Ham endure a difficult period, as all but the very best do, this helps to explain why there is less sympathy. Put simply, West Ham play like a bad team. And when they lose games the way that they lose them, they are a bad team. That can become really awkward for Moyes when that team includes players of the ability of Jarrod Bowen, Mohammed Kudus and the rest. ""We want to be a better football team, we are trying to become a better football team,"" he said recently. ""But maybe at the moment we have to get back to being a winning team, where wins do not really matter what they look like as long as we get the results."" But Moyes was appointed to this job in December 2019. Putting talk of an evolution in playing style on the backburner is a tricky argument to expect to land with supporters when a manager is more than four years into his second spell in charge. If not now, when? Attendances have almost doubled since the stadium move and that changes the dynamic too. For an additional 30,000 supporters, the joy of victory is more visceral, the pain of defeat more pronounced. It is easier to put down a phone or turn off a television than trudge back through Stratford, alone in thought or together in misery. That undoubtedly brings extra pressure. But these supporters are not deluded. They understand that nights like the one they enjoyed in Prague are not normal for West Ham. They have lived through the lean years. There is a gratitude for the good times under Moyes and a realisation that change brings risk. Even so, wanting it to look different to this is understandable.

181,Copenhagen 1-3 Man City: Pep Guardiola proud of 'perfect' win but Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva suffer injuries,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13071184/copenhagen-1-3-man-city-pep-guardiola-proud-of-perfect-win-but-jack-grealish-and-bernardo-silva-suffer-injuries,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Pep Guardiola described Manchester City's 3-1 victory over Copenhagen in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie as ""perfect"" but the result came at a cost with injuries to Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva. City extended their unbeaten run in Europe to 21 matches and made it 11 consecutive wins in all competitions by overcoming the Danish champions thanks to goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Silva and Phil Foden. De Bruyne struck the opener at Parken Stadium after just 10 minutes amid a dominant start which should have seen City further ahead before Grealish went off injured in the first half and an Ederson mistake allowed Copenhagen's Magnus Mattsson to equalise. Silva struck on the stroke of half-time to restore City's lead and after Erling Haaland had hit the crossbar, Foden netted in the 92nd minute to move Guardiola's side closer to the quarter-finals. Speaking to TNT Sports, the City boss said: ""It was really, really good. Today was perfect. They were patient in the right moments and I'm really proud of the team. ""The third goal helped us a lot. Hopefully, we can finish it off at home and go to the next game. ""It was important to not lose the tie here. The game was really well played from the first minute.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The only blots on an otherwise positive evening for City were injuries to Grealish and Silva. Grealish, handed his first start in six matches, lasted just 21 minutes while Silva took a knock to the ankle late in the game. Speaking about the two players post-match, Guardiola said: ""Bernardo has a big knock on his ankle. I didn't speak with the doctor but it looks muscular for Jack, his groin. ""It's a pity because, in the last few days, his mood in training was much better, he was playing really good, really good. He helped us to play at the right tempo. ""You cannot play so slow but you cannot play so fast against teams this organised, you have to find the right tempo and he helped us a lot."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It was another influential performance from City's star midfielder De Bruyne. The Belgian scored and grabbed two assists in Denmark to take his goal involvements to nine since returning from injury just last month. On the 32-year-old's impact, Guardiola said: ""Extraordinary. The first goal was amazing, the right pass and tempo from Phil Foden. ""The biggest players appear on the biggest stages. It's the hour of truth. We started well. We have to do our job and finish it. I'm just really pleased for the result."" ""I'm just trying to play good,"" De Bruyne told TNT Sports. ""It's been a long five or six months but I'm just happy to be back, helping the team win games and be at my best. ""I feel alright. Obviously, I still need a couple more games and minutes.

Jas Singh kept his eighth clean sheet in a row at the weekend to enter the record books at National League North leaders Tamworth FC for the most minutes played by a goalkeeper without conceding a goal in 91 years of club history. Safe hands Singh kept a clean sheet in a 1-0 win against Farsley Celtic, and has now gone 808 minutes since conceding a goal - breaking a club record previously set during the 1988/89 season by Dale Belford, a year before Singh was born. The victory against Farsley Celtic has sent Tamworth 12 points clear of Scunthorpe at the top of the table in what is looking increasingly like an unstoppable march to promotion to the National League. Goalkeeper Singh counts Shrewsbury Town, Telford United, Kidderminster Harriers, Gloucester City and Solihull Moors among his previous clubs. He won non-League Player of the Year at the 2013 Asian Football Awards and was named Tamworth's Players' Player of the Year in 2022. Singh appears to have now put himself firmly in contention for a place in next month's England C non-League squad.

""It's a great achievement and Singh and Tamworth have been a great partnership."" Women's FA Cup hero Sam Khan has announced her departure from Luton Town Ladies. Former Actonians striker Khan made an emotional return to her hometown club ahead of this season, and scored one of the most famous goals in Luton Town Ladies' modern history with her FA Cup third-round strike against Keynsham Town in December. Khan's winner set up a tie with WSL Brighton in a cup run that earned Luton almost £50,000 in prize money.

185,Oxford United unveil plans to build first all-electric stadium in UK,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13071399/oxford-united-unveil-plans-to-build-first-all-electric-stadium-in-uk,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Oxford United have announced plans to build the first stadium in the country powered solely by electricity to create a sustainable new home. As part of the club's pledge to deliver a state-of-the-art stadium it has outlined further details behind the proposed low-impact development. The club would use a low-carbon energy supply to create an 'all electric' stadium, with power also generated by solar panels. Jon Clarke, Development Director at Oxford United, said: ""The standout element of the stadium is it will be the most sustainable mid-sized sports venue in the country. We want to make the most of the opportunity to create something special - it would be one of the greenest football stadiums to be built."" The proposed 16,000 capacity stadium at the Triangle, near Kidlington in Oxford, would not use any high carbon intensity fossil fuels such as gas. Annually, electricity is now a cleaner fuel than natural gas. Renewable energy sources, including 3000m² of solar panels on the roof, along with energy efficiency measures would achieve radical carbon emission reductions. The solar panels would generate enough energy to boil around 3 million 3-litre kettles per year. Modern building fabric design and heat recovery solutions would also be used to maximise thermal efficiency. The use of another low-carbon energy technology, air source heat pumps, as the development's primary heat source would provide an estimated 80% reduction in CO2 emissions per year when compared to gas boilers, when aggregated over the year. Sky Sports' Future of Football series takes a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future... The news comes days after the club announced it has signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework to help tackle the climate crisis. By joining the Framework, the club has underlined its pledge to playing its part to ensure the sports sector achieves a low-carbon future. The club is committed to halving its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2040. Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! The stadium would also include drainage systems, rain storage and recycling solutions to re-use rainwater, while plans to enhance biodiversity on the land at the Triangle would achieve a significant net gain. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mr Clarke added: ""The stadium design has sustainability and visitor experience at its core. ""We've maximised modern technology, design and progressive thinking to create the benchmark for future design of stadiums with the protection of our planet in firm focus. ""By avoiding natural gas usage on site and by using highly efficient equipment to serve a high-quality building, the carbon emissions associated with this unique venue will be radically reduced resulting in a very low impact home."" In addition to onsite renewable energy through solar panels, the stadium design maximises efficiency in all aspects to minimise energy use and associated carbon emissions. It would include: The plans for the stadium include a 180-bed hotel, restaurant, conference centre, health & wellbeing space, gym and a community plaza. The club is currently preparing to submit its full planning application. Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue. In League Two, Forest Green Rovers are ""planning to build the world's greenest stadium"". Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green. The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as ""the world's first timber stadium."" Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts. ""The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,"" he said. ""Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else. ""There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero. ""The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,"" he added. ""For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles. ""When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain. ""It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too. ""I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch.""

187,Blackburn Rovers 1-2 Queens Park Rangers: Aynsley Pears' own goal and Joseph Hodge boost Rangers survival hopes,https://www.skysports.com/football/blackburn-vs-qpr/report/485050,Author not found,Publish time not found,"QPR scored twice in three second-half minutes to boost their survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Blackburn. QPR took a 61st-minute lead through an unfortunate Aynsley Pears own goal, which owed much to the magic of Ilias Chair, but it was the least they deserved and Joe Hodge's assured finish seven minutes into his QPR debut doubled their advantage. It was too much for Blackburn's supporters, who vociferously protested against owners Venky's and their CEO Steve Waggott before Sam Gallagher's fourth of the campaign halved the deficit 17 minutes from time. But the visitors held on for their first win on this ground since October 1999 and with Blackburn now only five points clear of danger after a winless run of eight, QPR may have dragged them into the relegation battle. Benjamin Chrisene should have given Rovers a fifth-minute lead when he found space inside the box and switched onto his right foot but got his curling effort all wrong and missed the target. QPR looked the most assured of the two sides though and Chair engineered space on the left soon after, cutting inside before unleashing a rasping shot that Pears tipped away. They went even closer when a flowing move saw Reggie Cannon cross for Sinclair Armstrong at the near post but he put his first-time shot the wrong side of the post. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports Rovers were toothless, though Joe Rankin-Costello forced Asmir Begovic into a low save before Armstrong's shot from a narrow angle was tipped behind. The visitors went close again two minutes after the restart when Chair whipped a dangerous cross to the back post that Steve Cook met but his header whistled just wide, before Armstrong missed a glaring chance when over-running the ball clean through, allowing Pears to smother. QPR got the goal their performance deserved just after the hour and it was thanks to the game's outstanding player in Chair, who jinked inside from the left and dummied before letting fly with a ferocious low 25-yard strike that clattered the post and rebounded in off Pears. They doubled their advantage three minutes later and there was no luck about this one as Armstrong found Hodge's perfectly timed run into the box and he had time to pick his spot, slotting the ball beyond Pears into the right corner. The atmosphere was bordering on mutinous after the second goal but Blackburn rallied and grabbed a lifeline when Rankin-Costello chased his mis-hit shot and bundled the ball into the path of Gallagher who fired through the legs of Begovic. Begovic produced a sprawling save to deny Gallagher, and Semir Telalovic poked over deep into added time, but QPR held on for a vital win. Blackburn's Jon Dahl Tomasson: ""We are disappointed to lose the game. I think actually we started really well. It was a good chance for Ben (Chrisene). Brilliant play, he should have scored that. ""I don't think the level is the same as Monday when we really played well and in the end of the game, we scored a good goal but we created plenty of chances to score goals. ""We conceded two unnecessary goals of course where we should have done better. We knew they could be dangerous in transition where we lost balls where normally we shouldn't lose balls. ""I think the lads and our fans showed great character. We almost got the draw. I think we had two or three good opportunities. Big chances to get the second. ""So all the credit to the players and actually also for the fans to stay behind the team but of course disappointed. We want to win games."" QPR's Marti Cifuentes: ""Important win for us, definitely because we knew we were playing against a team that offensively they are one of the best teams. ""When they are in possession, they can create a lot of chances and I think we contained them well for first 70-75 minutes. ""In addition, a difficult place for QPR historically, it's been a lot of years since the last victory. In this situation, where we are, every victory is so, so important with the results that happened today. ""It was not easy. I think small margins today, the goal of Ilias (Chair), a very brilliant action but today the ball rebounded and went in. Other days, unfortunately it's been post and out. ""I'm a big believer that the small margins when you work hard, when you work in a humble way, starts to pay off. Hopefully this will be what this team will start to achieve because since my arrival, the team has been competing very well in all the games. Hopefully this can be a turning point.""

188,Aberdeen 1-1 Celtic: Nicolas Kuhn rescues point for Hoops as fans protest at transfer business,https://www.skysports.com/football/aberdeen-vs-celtic/report/487729,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Nicolas Kuhn scored his first goal for Celtic but pre-match dissent from the visiting supporters at Pittodrie was amplified as a strong second-half performance from Aberdeen earned the hosts a point. Celtic ran out to chants of ""sack the board"" and a banner which read ""Celtic board, on your heads be it"" as the fans expressed their displeasure over the club's transfer window business. Their team had a goal disallowed and hit the bar twice in a one-sided first half but Bojan Miovski gave Aberdeen the lead with their first effort at goal in the 50th minute and his 19th goal of the season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  German winger Kuhn levelled in the 64th minute in his second appearance for Celtic but the game remained in the balance and the 1-1 draw ended a run of six consecutive wins for the cinch Premiership leaders since they lost back-to-back games in December. Aberdeen had first-team coach Peter Leven in charge following the sacking of manager Barry Robson and he handed a first start to the club's sole January signing, on-loan Crystal Palace midfielder Killian Phillips. Celtic had both of their new signings, German winger Kuhn and on-loan Norwich forward Adam Idah, on the bench as Maik Nawrocki replaced the injured Cameron Carter-Vickers. The defender's ball over the top earned Celtic their first real chance and Luis Palma was celebrating after converting the rebound from Liel Abada's saved effort. The Honduran winger was clearly offside though, however it took the VAR team several minutes to disallow the goal. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Celtic continued to create a steady stream of first-half chances. Kelle Roos saved comfortably from Palma and Abada and the former missed a great opportunity after Alistair Johnston's cross found him in space on the corner of the six-yard box. His shot hit the top of the bar and went over. Paulo Bernardo lobbed a delicate effort over a crowded goalmouth and off the top of the bar as Celtic continued to dominate. They had 13 first-half shots at goal, but only three on target with Matt O'Riley and Alexandro Bernabei off target just before the break. Aberdeen had barely managed to get the ball in the final third but they re-emerged from the interval with a new-found vigour and quickly turned defence into attack when a Celtic move up the left broke down. Dante Polvara's forward pass set Miovski up to run at Nawrocki and the striker shifted the ball inside before curling home from 18 yards. The game was transformed. Aberdeen threatened from a series of set-pieces with Celtic blocking several shots and Phillips almost made himself an instant hero with an audacious 45-yard chip which had Joe Hart beaten but just drifted off target. It was another recent signing that was soon celebrating though. Kuhn and Idah came on along with Anthony Ralston in the 59th minute and the winger soon made his mark as he cut in from the right, played a one-two and then got the ball back from Idah before shooting in off Nicky Devlin. Both teams went all out to get ahead. O'Riley saw a deflected effort hit the outside of the post and Hart saved from Connor Barron after Nawrocki's poor clearance. The offside flag went up after good chances at either end and Graeme Shinnie looked all set to score only to hit Hart with his shot. Leighton Clarkson looked offside from Shinnie's header before he got the ball back. Miovski was definitely offside when he beat Hart to Clarkson's low cross and knocked the ball into the net from close range. Celtic finished strongly but Roos came off his line to foil O'Riley and substitute Stephen Welsh headed over with the last action of the game before the away supporters resumed chants against the board while applauding the players. Aberdeen caretaker boss Peter Leven: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Celtic are a good team, they are going to pin you back but when we turned possession over, we just needed to make a few more passes. ""We knew Celtic were going to press the first five seconds. I just said 'believe in yourselves, be a bit more braver on the ball'. And I think you could see that in the second half. ""We had a few chances in the second half. The boys ran well second half, pressed them, passed the ball a lot better. It was just about belief."" Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""You always find that winning games and performing well can ease those situations, and that's what we aim to do. ""Supporters pay their money, they have every right to say what they want to say. ""For us it's the field, we can only control that. If we can do that, then we will be okay. ""Whatever goes on outside of the field, you have to be able to deal with that. ""At a club like Celtic, and the biggest clubs, there will always be that pressure there. I don't need to add any more pressure to the players. They understand, playing here. ""My job is to give them the confidence to find the results we need to find. But there's still so many games and a long, long way to go."" Aberdeen did not manage a single effort at goal in the first half but Bojan Miovski netted on the counter-attack in the 50th minute and the Dons had several opportunities to win the game in a strong second-half showing. Caretaker manager Peter Leven revealed his simple message to his players at half-time: ""Relax."" He added: ""Celtic are a good team, they are going to pin you back but when we turned possession over, we just needed to make a few more passes. ""We knew Celtic were going to press the first five seconds. I just said 'believe in yourselves, be a bit more braver on the ball'. And I think you could see that in the second half. ""We had a few chances in the second half. The boys ran well second half, pressed them, passed the ball a lot better. It was just about belief."" Aberdeen players were incensed that referee Steven McLean did not send off Maik Nawrocki after the defender fouled Miovski while already on a yellow card but Leven did not make much of the incident. ""I never saw it again,"" the first-team coach said. ""The second yellow card never happened but it's one of these things the referee has got to deal with.""

They are still well-placed in the race for the play-offs as well. Southampton's response to that defeat in midweek will be fascinating. They threatened it at the weekend, but bounced back to beat Huddersfield in remarkable fashion. Now they need to rally or Leeds could race away with second. I have a feeling they could slip again.Prediction: 2-1 (Sky Bet odds) Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Plymouth will feel so unfortunate in how they conceded that late equaliser against Coventry on Wednesday night. But they will have to put that to the backs of their minds because they are facing arguably the best team in the Championship at the minute. Leeds are in remarkable form. They absolutely destroyed Swansea in midweek and look unstoppable at the minute. There will be recent memories there of being pushed all the way at Home Park in the FA Cup, but I just can’t back against them right now. Away win!Prediction: 1-2 (Sky Bet odds) Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It has been two fantastic wins for Bristol City this week. To go to Middlesbrough and then end that run of Southampton has really set the Liam Manning era alight. They now need to continue that momentum. Championship table Championship fixtures QPR were so disappointing at Stoke, against a side that were there for the taking. They were rather flat and now find themselves four points adrift of safety. They can’t be that bad again, and I have a feeling they could cause a bit of a stir at Ashton Gate. Prediction: 1-1 (Sky Bet odds) Huddersfield are looking far more resilient and solid under their interim boss, and a massive win over Sunderland in midweek has dragged them a little away from the bottom three. Hull. Well what else can you say about that Jaden Philogene goal other than sheer brilliance. It was needed too as it triggered that turnaround at Rotherham to keep them in that play-off chasing pack. But Huddersfield have some momentum right now, and I think they could edge this one. Prediction: 2-1 (Sky Bet odds) Here is how and where you can watch Sky Bet Championship matches live across Sky Sports. That was a good win for Norwich in midweek. To see Watford battle back like that but then go on to win the game will have done them the world of good. There has been a lot of unease at Carrow Road this season, but they look on a good path right now. Cardiff could do with a bit of that because they look marooned in mid-table. They have just three points from their last five games. I can’t see them getting much of a return here. Home win.Prediction: 2-0 (Sky Bet odds) Swansea enjoyed an excellent win at Hull at the weekend that I certainly didn’t see coming, but followed it up by being steamrolled by Leeds. Not that you can blame them too much for that, with the form they are in right now. Ipswich got an enormous win on Wednesday night at Millwall to keep them within touch of that top-two race. But they need to be nearly faultless if they want to stay there now, and I don’t think it will be as easy for them as it was in midweek.

Cloe Lacasse scored twice, with a Kim Little penalty sandwiched in between, before Alessia Russo rounded off the scoring in the second half. The Gunners made light work of their Championship opposition in a game that was originally postponed due to a waterlogged pitch - and had seen London City head coach Carolina Morace sacked before the rescheduled fixture was confirmed. Lacasse redirected Stina Blackstenius' header on target to open the scoring in the 39th minute, before the Sweden forward was clumsily hauled down inside the box by goalkeeper Grace Moloney. The mistake gifted Little the chance from the penalty spot, an opportunity she rarely passes up, while a cooly-taken third was dispatched by Lacasse 12 minutes into the second period. Russo, on as a substitute, scored with almost her first touch when guiding a header beneath Moloney moments after replacing Blackstenius, completing the four-goal success.

South Africa midfielder Teboho Mokoena hit the outside of the post with the first kick before the next eight efforts were all successful, leaving DR Congo captain Chancel Mbemba needing to score to win the contest. But South Africa goalkeeper Ronwen Williams saved Mbemba's effort, taking the shootout into sudden death. Williams then saved again from Meschak Elia to win the tie. No extra time was played in the bronze medal match, which the Congolese dominated despite proving poor in front of goal. Silas Katompa had two glaring chances to put them ahead, first in the eighth minute when free on the left with just Williams to beat, but his hesitation allowed the keeper to grab the ball at his feet. When Williams dropped a high ball in his box midway through the second half, without any pressure on him, Katompa had an even easier chance but shot into the side netting. Fifteen minutes from the end, DR Congo striker Simon Banza also had clear sight on goal but botched his effort from point-blank range. Substitute Fiston Mayele did well to bring a long ball down on his chest and get goalside of his marker but he, too, missed as his effort in the 89th minute went across the face of goal.

195,Swansea 0-4 Leeds: United move up to second after emphatic win,https://www.skysports.com/football/swansea-vs-leeds/report/485079,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Leeds swept aside Swansea 4-0 to claim a seventh-consecutive Sky Bet Championship victory and equal their biggest win of the season. The hosts were left facing an uphill battle that proved well beyond them after Crysencio Summerville and former Swansea striker Joel Piroe struck inside the opening 10 minutes. Wilfried Gnonto added a brace to make it four goals in as many games, with Daniel Farke's side maintaining their push for an automatic promotion spot in style. Leeds had four former Swansea players in their matchday squad. Joe Rodon was at the heart of the defence and Piroe was drafted in to the attack after Patrick Bamford was injured during the warm-up. Wales internationals Connor Roberts and Daniel James - fit again after three weeks out with a hip injury - were among the substitutes. Relegation clouds were starting to hover over Swansea but they had been lifted by their weekend win at Hull, their first league success under Luke Williams at the fifth attempt. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports The Welsh club's feel-good factor quickly evaporated as Leeds cut through them at will in the opening stages and showed a ruthless edge in front of goal to match. After Swansea failed to clear their lines, Summerville scored his 16th goal of an increasingly-productive campaign with the help of a deflection off Jay Fulton. Two minutes later, Piroe - who scored 46 Swansea goals before joining Leeds for a reported £12million fee in August - was granted the freedom of a familiar penalty area to race on to Gnonto's pass. Piroe's shot had enough power to beat Carl Rushworth, who got a hand to it but was unable to deny the Dutchman his 11th Leeds goal. Rushworth prevented Gnonto and Georginio Rutter from adding to Swansea's misery, while Illan Meslier thwarted Brazilian winger Ronald at the other end. Ronald tangled with Junior Firpo, while some Swansea fans called for a penalty, but those appeals fell on deaf ears and Leeds effectively settled the contest after 35 minutes. Gnonto burst onto Archie Gray's clever pass and advanced unchecked before cutting inside Ben Cabango. The Italy international kept his composure to find the bottom corner of Rushworth's net from 10 yards. Swansea almost reduced the deficit at the start of the second half with Ronald, their main source of danger, firing a shot goalwards that Jamie Paterson diverted just wide. Paterson was on the end of another chance moments later but he sent his volley over before striking the Leeds wall from a free-kick. Leeds had taken their foot off the throttle in the second half as if the job was done. But Gnonto profited from another quick break, fed by Summerville and driving low past the exposed Rushworth as Leeds matched their four-goal December victory over Ipswich. Swansea's Luke Williams: ""It was a tough evening because we did not compete properly. Too timid. ""You cannot play like that. We played as if we were too scared to press and we allowed them time at the back of the pitch. ""We caused ourselves huge problems and then when we got in close contact, we didn't win enough tackles. ""If we're going to compete with these top teams we have to play a top model of football and that requires intensity and bravery. ""But you can't compete against Leeds playing like that."" Leeds' Daniel Farke: ""The win is just about us and what we do, our points tally. If you want to finish in the top positions, you need a special amount of wins and average points per game. ""We have a better average of two at the moment and that is quite impressive. ""In the last 20 years, above two points per game was always enough in position one. ""It will be difficult with (leaders) Leicester, but overall our record is really impressive and the best that the club has had in its history at this moment."" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play. Entries by 3pm Saturday."
196,Leeds United 3-0 Rotherham United: Crysencio Summerville scores twice in routine win for Daniel Farke's side,https://www.skysports.com/football/leeds-vs-rotherham/report/485067,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Leeds maintained their Championship promotion charge with a comfortable 3-0 win in a Yorkshire derby against Rotherham. Patrick Bamford put Leeds ahead in controversial circumstances at Elland Road with heavy suggestions of handball after a deflected cross appeared to brush his arm on its way in. Crysencio Summerville added a second after the break for the dominant Whites and later scored his second from the penalty spot as the hosts made it six Championship wins in succession. Leeds were aiming to maintain their unbeaten start to 2024 while Rotherham, the Championship's basement club, were seeking their first win since Boxing Day. Daniel Farke made six changes from the Leeds side that beat Plymouth in midweek FA Cup action and opposite number Leam Richardson named an unchanged team from that which tasted defeat to Southampton last weekend. After early Rotherham pressure, Wilfried Gnonto got in behind the Millers but was unable to find Summerville ahead of goalkeeper Viktor Johansson. Georginio Rutter's promising cross then found Bamford but his weak effort was claimed by Johansson after five minutes. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Bamford was denied before 10 minutes was played by Hakeem Odoffin's low tackle after Rutter's good work as the hosts continued to apply pressure. Leeds took the lead when Junior Firpo's left-wing cross deflected off Rotherham skipper Sean Morrison and struck what appeared to be Bamford's arm to put the Whites ahead. Rutter's shot from outside the box flew just over before Summerville wasted a glorious chance after Firpo robbed Odoffin and the winger blasted his 25th-minute effort over, with Rutter being denied by Johansson moments later. Ethan Ampadu's fantastic long pass put Bamford through one-on-one but he was unable to control it 10 minutes from half-time. Archie Gray nearly capped off a sustained Leeds move but fired straight at Johansson before the stopper denied Gnonto's fiercely-struck effort just before the break to keep the deficit at just one. Illan Meslier was sharp to control Glen Kamara's back pass and prevent an own goal early in the second half. Leeds should have doubled their lead when Bamford struck the bar and Gnonto blasted a follow-up over from close range. But Summerville gave Leeds a deserved second as he exchanged passes with Rutter and buried past an onrushing Johansson after 52 minutes. Referee Andrew Madley pointed to the penalty spot when Peter Kioso brought down Summerville and the winger coolly converted on the hour mark. Gnonto could have made it four but his low 78th-minute drive fizzed inches wide before a rare Millers foray forward saw Christ Tiehi blast over following a corner. Johansson collected Rutter's header as full-time approached before Meslier denied Odoffin's header at the other end, with Rutter blasting inches wide in stoppage time. Leeds' Daniel Farke: ""If I'm honest I haven't watched it back, someone mentioned it's a possible handball or the ball was deflected by Patrick's arm. For me it's not possible to judge it. ""You have to say if it was a handball then probably it should have been not allowed but if I'm really honest normally you say over the course of a season everything is a bit equal. ""I also think normally it's important during a game if it's a goal or not a goal but today it was not important because we created so many chances. ""I think even if this situation would have been disallowed, I think it would still be the same outcome and to win. I think in the end it was not a decisive moment, we were too dominant. ""Rotherham is a side which still fights until the end in order to be successful in this relegation battle, they never gave up, also in the last 10 minutes they had a few set pieces, so that we are happy with the 3-0."" Rotherham's Leam Richardson: ""I thought we started the game in the ascendancy and the goal hasn't cost the result but it's led to a large part of it with the handball, so you're disappointed for the players with the work ethic they've put in. ""But congratulations to Leeds, they're up there for a reason, you can see the quality of player and what happens if you give them chances. ""With the result, I think the 10 minutes in the second half [where Leeds scored twice] killed the game. ""Their first goal was disappointing with how it came about with the decision because I think it's an easy decision. But I'm very respectful of the officiating, they've got a million and one things to make. ""Andy has apologised but I didn't really appreciate the linesman who was on this side laughing and joking with Patrick after the game. ""I think that's unprofessional but that's not an excuse and we'll move on from that. That's their takeaway to get better themselves.""

197,Norwich 4-2 Watford: Gabriel Sara and Christian Faasnacht net crucial goals in Canaries win,https://www.skysports.com/football/norwich-vs-watford/report/485077,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Norwich recovered from losing a two-goal lead to beat Watford 4-2 at Carrow Road and maintain their Championship play-off push. The Canaries appeared to be in command after scoring twice in eight first half minutes through Ashley Barnes and Josh Sargent, only for Hornets to hit back as Mileta Rajovic netted just before the break and Yaser Asprilla scored a long-range stunner to equalise midway through the second period. But the home side kept their nerve and two quick goals from Gabriel Sara and Christian Fassnacht sealed a hard fought win that made it nine home games without defeat, while dealing another blow to Watford's rapidly receding hopes of finishing in the top six. Norwich made a bright start and deservedly took the lead after 20 minutes, with a little help from goal-line technology. When Barnes got his head on Onel Hernandez's cross to the back post it appeared as though Ben Hamer had made a spectacular one-handed save to keep it out. But it was all to no avail, with referee Stuart Atwell signalling a goal after being informed that the ball had crossed the line before the keeper's last-gasp intervention. Hamer made another save which counted for nothing eight minutes later as the Canaries doubled their advantage. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This time he parried Sargent's penalty, awarded for a foul on Kenny McLean by Wesley Hoedt, only for the ball to rebound kindly for the American to nod home his seventh goal of an injury-hit campaign. Norwich looked in complete control at that stage but Watford got themselves back in it through Rajovic after 42 minutes. Ismael Kone picked out Ken Sema's run down the inside left channel and what appeared to be an attempt at a shot turned into a perfect cross for Rajovic to poke home from inside the six-yard box. The Hornets might have got back on level terms a few minutes later after Barnes was caught in possession in a dangerous area but Matheus Martins delayed too long and his shot was blocked. Watford wasted another good opportunity seven minutes into the second period when Sema dragged his shot wide from a good position after being set up by Martins' cutback. Despite being in front Norwich were beginning to look more than a little nervous, with the crowd getting edgy too, and the mood slumped still further as the visitors scored a quite brilliant equaliser after 71 minutes. The home defence were guilty of failing to close down substitute Asprilla as he made ground towards their goal down the left and the Colombia international took full advantage, beating Angus Gunn from all of 30 yards, with his searing effort going in off the woodwork. It was the second time this season that Watford had come from 2-0 down to level against Norwich - but this time it was the Canaries who scored the fifth goal of the game. With 77 minutes on the clock Barnes did well to control the ball and switch it to the overlapping Sara, and the Brazilian burst into the box before beating Hamer with a low shot into the far corner. Five minutes later Norwich gave themselves some breathing space by making it 4-2, with Jack Stacey's cross being turned in from close range by substitute Fassnacht via a big deflection off Ryan Porteous. Norwich's David Wagner: ""We are talking about a small group but I think they should stay at home if they are going to be like that, because it clearly affected the players on the pitch. It was just unacceptable in my view. ""Both Onel and Josh were struggling with injuries and that is why I took them off - I think the players who came on deserved more respect, they shouldn't have heard booing when they came on. And I think I deserve more respect too. ""We know the target in front of us, we know the chance we have got and we need all the supporters to be behind us. Hopefully the bigger group can be louder and we don't hear what the small group are saying. ""I thought it was a big result tonight - in the first half I thought we were outstanding. And after it went to 2-2 we kept playing our football and scored two more goals. I am very proud off all the players."" Watford's Valerien Ismael: ""It is very frustrating - we are scoring goals at the moment but we are conceding too many as well and that makes it very difficult. ""After finding ourselves 2-0 down we then got ourselves back in it. From that moment I thought the momentum changed and we had a great chance to equalise just before half-time through Matheus (Martins). ""In the second half I thought we got on top and Yaser (Asprilla) equalises with an incredible shot. ""But from then on it was very disappointing - all the players on the pitch need to be 100 percent committed to helping their colleagues. ""You need to win your duels in football, that is one of the basics of the game, and we lost the control that we had. ""The players have had their say in the dressing room and all we can focus on now is going out and trying to win our next match.""

198,Igor Thiago: Who is the Club Brugge striker heading to the Premier League as Brentford's possible Ivan Toney replacement?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11748/13072079/igor-thiago-who-is-the-club-brugge-striker-heading-to-the-premier-league-as-brentfords-possible-ivan-toney-replacement,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Are Brentford already preparing for life after Ivan Toney? In Igor Thiago, the 22-year-old Brazilian forward signed for £30m this week from Club Brugge, Thomas Frank is getting ahead of the curve. ""I'm very pleased that we have been proactive as a club; big credit to Matthew Benham [the Brentford owner], Phil Giles [the director of football] and Lee Dykes [the technical director] for the hard work they have done,"" Frank said. ""We have signed a key player for a key position. He is hardworking and a very good pressing player. He is also a physical presence, very good in the box and can link the play."" Brentford have the option of extending Thiago's five-year contract, which starts on July 1, by one year. Toney recently returned to action after serving an eight-month ban for 232 breaches of the FA's rules for betting on football - and Bees boss Frank reiterated this month that the striker ""will probably be sold this summer"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It is relatively obvious,"" Frank said when asked if Brentford would be without Toney next season. ""We also know what he is worth. I don't think there are many strikers in the world who are better than him right now."" With one England cap to his name, Toney wants to further his career and is on the radar of several top clubs across Europe and the Premier League, including Chelsea, while Arsenal are also reported to be keen, but the west London club kept hold of their talisman in the January transfer window. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App With interest in the 27-year-old set to ramp up again at the end of the season, Brentford have moved early to ensure they are not scrambling for a Toney replacement at an inflated price. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The arrival of Thiago should soften the blow. Born in Gama, he had to grow up fast following the loss of his father at a young age. Thiago supported his mother financially by working in construction. His break in football came as a result of his brother being on the books of Gremio Ocidental but it was only when regional club Vere FC offered him the chance to make the grade that his footballing career began to take shape. Four years ago, as an 18-year-old, he made his professional debut for Cruzeiro in their Campeonato Mineiro encounter with Boa Esporte Clube. Like most Brazilians, the dream was to one day move to Europe to test himself further and to better support his family. After 10 goals in 64 appearances for Cruzeiro, the opportunity came to join national champions Ludogorets in Bulgaria. For Thiago, this was a complete culture shock but an obstacle he would grab with both hands - he scored on his debut before notably recording an 11-minute hat-trick during an 8-1 victory over Botev Vratsa last April. It was not long before his impressive one-in-two goal record was alerting the attention of bigger clubs. After scoring 16 goals in 34 league games at Ludogorets across the 2022/23 season, Club Brugge paid €8m (£6.8m) to sign him on a four-year contract - a record fee received by a Bulgarian club. In the Europa Conference League this season - including qualifiers - he has scored six goals in 12 games. In the group stage, only Gift Orban, Benjamin Nygren and Eran Zahavi scored more as Club Brugge qualified for the last 16. Brentford are recruiting a poacher. Seven of his 16 league goals this term have come from inside the six-yard box, while a further six have been scored from the penalty spot. Neal Maupay has benefitted from the return of Toney as a focal point, as seen by how the striker used his physical presence to provide a non-assist for the Frenchman's opener in the 3-1 defeat at home to Manchester City. Maupay, who is on loan from Everton with an option to make the transfer permanent, could feed off Thiago's appetite for an aerial duel having won 35 balls on such occasions - the seventh most across forwards this term in Belgium. The 6ft 2in striker has also made 23 key passes to demonstrate he is more than just a finisher but someone Brentford fans can expect to provide link-up play in much the same way Toney drops deep to combine with his midfielders at the Gtech Stadium. Brentford's direct style of play has sparked back into life since Toney's return. With Thiago arriving on July 1 when the summer transfer window opens, Frank and his scouting team have lined up the ideal replacement to compliment his playing style.

199,Tottenham 2-1 Brighton: Brennan Johnson scores stoppage-time winner to move Spurs into top four,https://www.skysports.com/football/tottenham-vs-brighton/report/482828,Declan Olley,Publish time not found,"Substitute Brennan Johnson scored a dramatic 96th-minute winner to give Tottenham a 2-1 comeback home victory over Brighton to move into the top four. Johnson slammed home a last-gasp goal which was set up by fellow substitute Heung-Min Son on his first Spurs appearance of 2024 after he returned from the Asian Cup. Brighton had taken a deserved 17th-minute lead when Micky van de Ven fouled Danny Welbeck inside the box to allow Pascal Gross to score a penalty. Tottenham: Vicario (7); Porro (6), Romero, (7) Van de Ven (6), Udogie (6); Sarr (8), Bentancur (6); Kulusevski (6), Maddison (6), Werner (6); Richarlison (7).


Subs used: Son (7), Bissouma (6), Johnson (7), Hojbjerg (n/a), Davies (n/a).


Brighton: Steele (7); Lamptey (6), Van Hecke (7), Dunk (6), Estupinan (6); Gross (7), Gilmour (7); Buonanotte (6), Lallana (6), Mitoma (7); Welbeck (6).


Subs used: Fati (6), Ferguson (n/a), Veltman (n/a), Baker-Boaitey (n/a), Baleba (n/a).


Player of the match: Pape Sarr. But Spurs' pressure eventually told when Pape Sarr rebounded home a 61st-minute equaliser to ensure Tottenham scored for a 36th consecutive Premier League game - the joint-second longest scoring streak by a side in the competition's history. Brighton, who were without boss Roberto De Zerbi with the Italian recovering from ""invasive dental surgery"", came close to retaking the lead when substitute Ansu Fati steered wide in the 76th minute. But with seconds remaining Tottenham struck through Johnson to move a point above Aston Villa into fourth, with Unai Emery's side hosting Manchester United on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Brighton's agonising defeat damages their European qualification hopes as they remain eighth and are 11 points off fifth-placed Villa. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! It was always going to be a match that promised drama and goalmouth action and it delivered from the first whistle, with Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario making a fine save after just 47 seconds to deny Welbeck's curling effort from inside the box. Brighton's fast start was eventually rewarded when Van de Ven clumsily fouled Welbeck inside the box to allow Gross to score a 17th-minute spot-kick. Tottenham responded well with Richarlison's one-on-one finish superbly stopped by Brighton goalkeeper Jason Steele in the 22nd minute, as James Maddison then bent one wide four minutes later. The end-to-end encounter then saw Vicario make his second top save as he prevented Kaoru Mitoma's inventive outside-of-the-boot effort from flying in. Tottenham pushed for a leveller before half-time but were frustrated as Richarlison put his third shot of the half wide from Timo Werner's cross, and then Steele denied Dejan Kulusevski moments later. Spurs continued their pressure on the Brighton goal in the second half as Maddison had a 48th-minute free-kick saved before Werner saw a low shot from outside the box deflect wide. But the home side's dominance finally paid off when Kulusevski laid in Sarr whose first-time effort was deflected onto the post before the midfielder rebounded home to bring Spurs level in the 61st minute. Immediately after the equaliser, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou made a triple change a Son was brought on to a huge reception following his return from the Asian Cup. The South Korean, who took the captain's armband from Cristian Romero, nearly made an instant impact as he slipped in Johnson but his low shot was straight at Steele. Despite Son's introduction, Brighton took control of the game and came close to retaking the lead twice in the space of a minute as substitute Fati rolled past the far post from Mitoma's cross before Van de Ven blocked Facundo Buonanotte's strike just wide. But, just as the game looked to be heading for a draw, Richarlison played in Son, who crossed for Johnson to strike a late winner to send the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium into pandemonium. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou told Sky Sports: ""Scoring in the last minute you have those mixed feelings of joy and relief. First half, we lacked things but second half was better, we put them under more pressure and played cleaner football and ultimately got the rewards. ""The positive thing is that we had players being able to come on that could make an impact for us, which does make a difference particularly when games are tight if you can bring on some quality and both of those contributions were key. ""Big [to have Son back] because he's our leader and he's a world-class player. Before he went away he was the top striker in the league in terms of his goal involvements and his influence so it's great to get him back."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brighton assistant coach Andrea Maldera told Sky Sports: ""In the first half he [De Zerbi] watched the game. At half-time I spoke with him and he told me something, and in the second half when there were a lot of substitutions he was on the phone to our assistants on the bench. The substitutions were his idea. ""He watched the game from Italy. The communication is sometimes not easy because when you speak to the bench or the phone the football is going on. It's tough for the players as well because for them it's not easy. ""Roberto is our leader. It's okay if he can stay on the bench if he's suspended but not to stay with us all week is not easy. The players worked it very well and I'm disappointed for them because today they fight a lot. They wanted the result for Roberto but this is football. ""We are disappointed with the result because they deserve to draw, maybe win, but not lose the game."" For most of the second half, it looked as though the narrative after this game was going to be how Ange Postecoglou's substitutions backfired. The Tottenham manager made a triple change in the 63rd minute, bringing on Son, Johnson and Yves Bissouma moments after Sarr has scored his side's equaliser. Spurs were enjoying their best spell of the game - but with the subs came a loss of momentum. Werner's pace, Kulusevski's creativity and Rodrigo Bentancur's control had been lost. Instead, Brighton regained the upper hand, while Spurs mustered just two shots in the following 30 minutes. But then the changes paid off. With space to run into after a turnover in possession, Son did what Werner could not during his time on the pitch, executing the perfect pass for an unmarked Johnson to fire into the net. After producing so little for most of the second half, Postecoglou's two attacking subs combined to score the winner - Spurs' fifth in a row at home in the Premier League. As the delirious celebrations at full-time showed, Postecoglou can do no wrong in the eyes of Spurs' supporters.Joe Shread Roberto De Zerbi may have been back in Italy due to a combination of dental surgery and a touchline ban but the approach of his side in north London was familiar - risky, aggressive and highly entertaining. Ultimately, that high-stakes approach cost them, with a loss of possession in a dangerous area as they looked to clinch an impressive away win allowing Johnson to deliver a sucker punch deep into injury time. It's tempting to conclude that Brighton should have been more cautious. But in fact, Johnson's winner was the first time they have dropped points in the Premier League this season by conceding in the 75th minute or later. What's more, the Seagulls have come from behind to claim draws in the final 15 minutes on four separate occasions. Brighton's attacking approach works - just look at the progress they have made under De Zerbi since his arrival in the autumn of 2022. They were on top in the final 30 minutes at Spurs and just as easily could have been celebrating a late win of their own. But Seagulls fans know by now that, with De Zerbi in charge, there will be the occasional bitter blow along with the thrilling highs.Joe Shread Tottenham return to Premier League action next Saturday when they host Wolves; kick-off 3pm.

201,Striver: How Gilberto Silva and Roberto Carlos are plotting to disrupt social media with world's first abuse-free app,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13049747/striver-how-gilberto-silva-and-roberto-carlos-are-plotting-to-disrupt-social-media-with-worlds-first-abuse-free-app,Dan Long,Publish time not found,"Tim Chase's excitement is hard to conceal as he sits down with Sky Sports' Dan Long. The former tech headhunter is here to talk about his brainchild, an app called Striver - the self-proclaimed world's first abuse-free social media platform, which was publicly launched at Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon back in November. That in itself is an enticing prospect. The amount of negativity on the likes of Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram seems to significantly outweigh the positivity these days. But there's a boyish grin on Chase's face as he begins to tell Striver's story - and it's easy to understand why. ""When your business partners are Gilberto Silva and Roberto Carlos, magic happens!"" Ex-Arsenal midfielder Gilberto - a friend of Chase's since 2016 - is an investor and his fellow 2002 World Cup winner is an ambassador. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The app is similar in appearance to TikTok - the newest major player in social media - but the team behind the scenes are using challenges to draw people in. Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports For example, say Roberto Carlos recreates that mind-blowing, physics-defying free-kick he scored against France, uploads it to Striver and invites users to record footage of themselves attempting to replicate it. He can then click the 'Feature' button on any of those replies; the user gets a notification to say he's seen it and all of his audience can then watch it and respond themselves. Gilberto, meanwhile, could post a video asking people what they think of Arsenal's chances of winning the Premier League this season and feature responses in the same manner. The headline-grabbing feature - Striver's USP - is that abuse will not feature anywhere on the platform, so how does the app back up its claim? ""We feel prevention is better than a cure and we found there was AI (Artificial Intelligence) available to moderate content, which means we don't even have to remove the abusive content from the platform - we actually stop it going live,"" Chase explains. ""With comments, we look at words, phrases, sentences and then the message as a whole. Comments don't necessarily have to be positive, but they are not abusive. ""Then, for videos, we remove the audio and moderate that in the same way we do for comments and then, for the video, we take a screenshot every 0.3 of a second and moderate each screenshot. ""A response to Harry Maguire's challenge from a Man Utd fan outside Old Trafford was rejected recently and we couldn't work out why. There's a bottle of wine in the background and on the label, there's the word 'diablo' which means 'devil' in Spanish. ""We knew our AI was powerful - it's currently 99.9817 per cent effective - but we didn't realise how powerful it is becoming. As the founder of the programme, that really excited me."" In future, there will be facial recognition and age-appropriate moderation; if you're over 18, there will be a slider for users to select the level of bad language that is shown. It begs the question: why hasn't anyone done this before? ""Commercially, I understand why the big platforms haven't done it; they are 20-years-old, in some cases, and this is just the modern way of doing it. ""The emergence of TikTok shows that people do want to engage and do the things you can see the stars and influencers doing. But with these platforms, they're so concerned with getting content on the platform, then worrying about the abusive content afterwards. ""If it goes live, the damage has already been done - there's no point bringing it down after an hour. Bad news travels fast on social media and it's really hard to bring it back in."" Needless to say, it has been easy to get current and former professionals involved. Alongside Gilberto and Roberto Carlos, Manchester United and England defender Harry Maguire is an ambassador, as is another former Gunner, Sol Campbell. Papa Pincus - who has over 130,000 followers on Twitter - has recently signed up as an official creator, too. ""It's been pretty easy to get players on board,"" Chase says, taking notable pride in his efforts. ""We're talking to clubs and major brands, as well. ""The trojan horse is the abuse-free stuff and then we're in. If we remove the top layer of abuse, the players want to engage more with the fans, the fans want to engage more with each other and the clubs want to engage with everybody. ""My position on this is that every social platform is the same; it's about how many likes you've got, how many followers you've got and how many views you get. It's only the way it displays the content that is different. Ours is just upsetting everything, disrupting."" As a father himself, Gilberto says Chase's initial purpose immediately resonated with him. ""I have the possibility to help put the project on the market and support people to interact with others in a safe place. This is a key point for me,"" says the Brazilian. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Now we are in the position to be able to generate awareness by saying maybe some people have been abused on the internet, but now you have Striver, where you can moderate the conversation and get the support. ""The idea is not to stop people talking. I can have a different opinion to you about football - that's not a problem. The problem begins when you start abusing others."" Having played during a time when the use of social media was in its infancy - and thus abuse was not among the headlines as often as it is today - Gilberto used his platform to engage with his followers, communicating results, day-to-day life and more. For the most part, it was friendly; for the general public, there was still a real sense of novelty in discovering previously inaccessible details. But even then, he was not immune to the vitriol that has, sadly, become commonplace. ""After I finished my contract, at Atletico Mineiro back in Brazil, I had a problem with my knee. I went to the club and told them I wanted their support, but nothing was done. ""Later on, I took them to court. This was not something that made me happy or proud. In all honesty, it was terrible to make this decision. ""The consequence was there were some reactions from the fans, which were very bad for me. ""There were many of them who came onto social media and smashed me. At one point, I was scared of going outside my house, thinking somebody could wait for me outside or stop me on the street. That was a tough time."" That first-hand experience is, without doubt, Gilberto's driving force. ""I think I'm working harder than when I was playing!"" he says with a smile.

202,Five Champions League places for Premier League? How extra team can qualify in 2024,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12940385/explained-how-more-than-four-premier-league-teams-can-qualify-for-next-seasons-champions-league,Ben Grounds,Publish time not found,"The German Bundesliga has leapfrogged England's Premier League in the race for a bonus Champions League spot next season - but how does it work? For the first time, five Premier League teams could qualify for the Champions League through their league position. Traditionally, there have only been four clubs who have qualified through their league place. This will be the final season of the existing format - 32 teams in the group phase, split up into eight groups of four, with the top two progressing. The change will see 36 teams competing in the competition in a 'Swiss league' style, allowing for an additional place to be allocated to the two countries whose clubs perform best across all UEFA competitions. Italy and Germany currently hold those positions, with the latter leapfrogging England after the midweek Europa League and Europa Conference League play-off knockouts. Six English sides have reached the round of 16 across UEFA competitions, with Manchester City - who beat Copenhagen 3-1 in the first leg - and Arsenal in the Champions League, Liverpool, West Ham and Brighton in the Europa League and Aston Villa in the Europa Conference League - only Manchester United and Newcastle failed to progress to the knockout stages.

The number of points awarded each season is divided by the number of teams that participated for that association in that season and rounded to three decimal places. Regarding the final bullet point, those two associations will earn one place for the club best ranked in the domestic league behind the UEFA Champions League positions. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For example, based on the collective performance of their clubs last season, England and Italy would have both had an additional spot in the Champions League - meaning Liverpool and Atalanta - both fifth in their respective leagues - would have entered the competition. Previously in 2005, when Liverpool won the Champions League but finished outside of the top four, the Premier League was granted five potential Champions League berths with the caveat of having to go through qualifiers. During the 2015/16 season, Spain became the first association to have five teams in the Champions League group stage after Sevilla lifted the Europa League despite finishing outside the top four in LaLiga the previous campaign and Valencia came through the play-off round. The Premier League has confirmed that in five of the last six seasons and seven of the past 11, the performance of English clubs in Europe would have merited an additional spot. Remarkably, there is an extremely unlikely chance of there being as many as seven Premier League clubs in the Champions League next season based on the change in rules. That would require both the Champions League and Europa League winners to be from the Premier League and both teams finishing outside the top five. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Taking the total number of teams from 32 to 36 in the Champions League, the biggest change will see a transformation from the traditional group stage to a single league phase including all participating teams. Every club will now be guaranteed a minimum of eight league stage games against eight different opponents (four home games, four away) rather than the previous six matches against three teams, played on a home-and-away basis. The top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the knockout stage, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off to secure their path to the last 16 of the competition. Given that the Champions League will almost double in size - from a total of 125 games to 225 - at least four additional matchdays will be required to fit in the extra games. This will inevitably cause issues for domestic leagues, with fewer dates to fit in all their games. At the time of the new model's announcement back in April 2021, then Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan said: ""More and more games, is no one thinking about us players? The new UCL format is just the lesser of the two evils in comparison to the Super League."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Qualification for the two other UEFA competitions, the Europa League and Europa Conference League, will follow the same protocols as in previous years, albeit if the fifth spot qualifies for the Champions League, the Europa League spot will go to the team finishing sixth. Similar format changes will also be applied to the Europa League (eight matches in the league stage) and Europa Conference League (six matches in the league stage) and both will also include 36 teams in the league phase. Yes it does - provided the domestic cups are won by those finishing inside the top seven as seen last season with Manchester United winning the Carabao Cup and Manchester City winning the FA Cup. Based on last season, eighth-placed Tottenham would have qualified for the Europa Conference League and Aston Villa would have been promoted to the Europa League.

Bacuna was seen in conversation with the officials and senior stewards, pointing to somebody in the home end during the 1-0 defeat at West Brom on Saturday. WMP say a 50-year-old from Dudley has been detained and questioned on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. They are also appealing to supporters in the Halfords Lane Stand who saw or heard the incident to assist with the investigation.

205,"Five hours training a day, internet & meeting David Beckham: Path to Pro",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13023155/five-hours-training-a-day-internet-meeting-david-beckham-path-to-pro,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Ever wondered what it takes to become a pro gamer? Guild Academy Esports player Ben 'Brig' Brigdale gives an insight into the hours of daily practice needed, why fast internet is a must, and what it was like to meet David Beckham. Brig, 18, met Beckham as part of Guild Esports' partnership with Sky Broadband, with the former England captain gifting the youngster Sky Full Fibre broadband to aid in his quest to becoming a pro gamer. This all took place through Sky Broadband’s new 3 part series, Path to Pro, that is available to watch now on YouTube, following Ben, Ruby and Suleymon on their path to becoming pro gamers. Brig described weak internet as a ""nightmare"" for gamers, but unlike traditional broadband (also known as FTTC), Sky Full Fibre is powered by a fibre cable direct to your home, giving you a faster and more reliable broadband connection. ""Sometimes the internet was struggling a bit, for gaming you need stable internet,"" Brig said. ""Lagging in any game is an absolute nightmare. If you've not got the best speeds it's a struggle. I've messaged mates and gone round their house to play sometimes. ""Words can't really describe how grateful I am for [Full Fibre]."" The amount Brig and other esports gamers are practising requires that strength of connection. Incredibly, Brig revealed he is practicing EA Sports' FC 24, previously FIFA, for up to five hours a day. More about Guild Esports More about Sky Full Fibre ""I was putting in at least 4-5 hours minimum, and now it's 5-6 hours, constantly trying to find ways to get better. I knew I had to put in the time and effort to try and compete. Knowing the game, what works, what doesn't."" Brig's path to pro began with competitive match-ups against his brother and Dad, and he now hopes to take his skills to new levels with help from Guild Esports, and of course his new stronger internet. ""My brother's older than me and was always playing, and you get that competitiveness from that. To be honest, my Dad and brother used to beat me a lot, and it used to really annoy me! Which I think is why I've got competitive now. ""I always knew about the pro scene. I used to watch loads of tournaments but was never old enough to compete. I played a European tournament for the first time, and finished in the top 64 to 32. ""Everyone wants to win a trophy, come out with success, but to be honest for me I want to experience everything in esports. I want to enjoy what I'm doing, I don't want to be dreading playing, I want to go to tournaments and enjoy it."" But what mental skills are needed to get to Brig's level? He takes inspiration from his experience playing cricket. ""Competing online is a patience game. It tests your mentality. If you really want to win, you have to put your head down and stay composed, stay patient, and it's just a waiting game. ""I play a lot of cricket. Cricket is to some people a long and boring sport. But you have to be patient, you're out there for a long time, and be switched on and ready for the whole time. If you switch your game off for a second, you're out. You have to stay patient and not get frustrated. ""It's the same with gaming, if I play against someone who is very slow, and I play very quick, I have to adapt, but be patient until he makes the moves. The minute you lose concentration, you get punished for it at the top level of gaming."" Gaming has opened Brig up to a new community of personalities and friends, and admits his successes so far have increased his confidence in everyday life. ""I've made a lot of mates through it. You talk to people on these platforms, and through them you talk about other stuff too, in general, normal life. ""I'd say it has [increased my confidence]. When I go out with my family, and people know about what I do, they ask me quite a lot of questions about it. Before I maybe wouldn't talk about it. I now openly talk about it, and I get opportunities that people don't really get."" And what was it like to meet David Beckham? ""I've still not accepted the fact I met David Beckham and spoke to him! I've still got family members asking me about it! I pretty much had an hour-long conversation with him about my gaming experience, and he understood part of what I was talking about because he'd gone through an academy as a footballer. ""It was a surreal moment, I'm a massive football fan, so to actually speak to him was unbelievable. To even have the opportunity to speak to him, even for two minutes, to get an hour with him, it was unbelievable."""
206,Preston North End 3-2 Ipswich Town: Tractor Boys slip out of top two with defeat,https://www.skysports.com/football/preston-vs-ipswich/report/485056,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Ipswich missed their chance to move back into the Championship top two as they fell to a 3-2 defeat at Preston. A week after being embarrassed by non-league Maidstone in the FA Cup, the Tractor Boys were unable to restore their pride as they capitulated in what proved to be a nightmare first half at Deepdale thanks to a Will Keane brace and George Edmundson's own goal. Debutant Kieffer Moore came off the bench after half-time and bagged two goals to threaten a dramatic comeback late on, but Preston hung on for a victory which eased them back closer to the play-off places. The writing was on the wall for Ipswich almost from the first whistle and Liam Millar had already gone close by the time Preston notched their opener after five minutes. Keane grabbed it, firing home from 20 yards via a hefty deflection off defender Edmundson after he had met Ben Whiteman's pass. It got even worse for the unfortunate Edmundson just three minutes later. With Emil Riis darting on to Keane's smart through-ball, Edmundson got a foot in to tackle, only to direct the ball past goalkeeper Vaclav Hladky and into the gaping goal. Ipswich looked all at sea but did manage to steady the ship somewhat, although by the half-hour mark they still had not troubled North End keeper Freddie Woodman. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports At the other end, Preston had gone off the boil slightly but Ryan Lowe's men managed to add a third six minutes before the break. This time Mads Frokjaer pounced on an awful pass out from the decidedly shaky Hladky, with the ball eventually springing out for Keane to easily slot home his second from close range. Ipswich had clearly endured a stern talking-to from boss Kieran McKenna at the break and they almost reduced the deficit soon after the restart. Leif Davis took aim from a free-kick but his shot bounced out off a post. As the hour mark passed, Jeremy Sarmiento tried his luck from distance but Woodman was equal to the task and saved competently. Substitute Moore, making his debut following his midweek loan switch from Bournemouth, also headed just off target and it was looking like it was not going to be Ipswich's day, until the same player gave them hope after 74 minutes, leaping highest to nod home Davis's cross. When Moore tapped home to make it 3-2 with three minutes left, there were gasps of concern from the home faithful, but Preston hung to secure an eye-catching win. Preston's Ryan Lowe: ""The lads have been fantastic. I thought everything they did from start to finish was brilliant. ""It had to be because Ipswich are a top quality side. It was great to be three up at half-time, but we knew Ipswich weren't out of it and they'd fight so hard in the second half. ""We knew there would be a reaction. They brought Moore on and he was a real handful, and they went a bit more direct but we defended brilliantly. ""The players have showed a terrific mentality today. We've shown we can beat a top side like Ipswich, so now it's maybe about beating more of the teams in and around us if we're going to challenge near the top. ""Even at 3-0 at half-time I was a little bit scared to say too much in the dressing room. ""That was for fear of upsetting our rhythm too much, but we've hung on against a good team with a great manager who has really got them going this season."" Ipswich's Kieran McKenna: ""You're always trying to have that variety you need in your playing squad. Having options like Kieffer means you can help to have variety in your play, especially in your attacking play. ""I think that's something we've done really well over the past 12 months. We've been good at finding those different ways to threaten teams. ""My belief has always been that we have to adapt to the quality of the players at our disposal and try our best to utilise their best attributes. That's while staying true to our beliefs about how we want to play and how we want an Ipswich team to look. ""It proved to be a really difficult first half at what is a difficult place to come to. ""We lacked enough profile and presence in that first half and ultimately it cost us. ""We needed to improve of course, and we did, and by the end of the game I thought we probably deserved to get something out of the game. ""It's a blow at this stage of the season, but we can only improve on that first-half performance. There's still a long way to go.""

Loftus-Cheek's double takes him to five goals in five games for Milan, who take a strong advantage into next Thursday's second leg. Portugal forward Rafael Leao added the third goal for the Italians. The victors of these ties will progress to the last 16 where they will face the teams that won their Europa League group. Romelu Lukaku's second-half goal secured a 1-1 draw for Roma at Feyenoord.

Bodo/Glimt's Odin Luras Bjortuft gave away a penalty and was sent off for a foul on reported Man Utd target Brian Brobbey, which sparked Ajax's dramatic late turnaround. Belgian league leader Union Saint-Gilloise also came back from two goals down to salvage a 2-2 home draw against Eintracht Frankfurt despite having a player sent off. Forward Mika Biereth scored the opening goal early on for Sturm Graz in a 4-1 victory over 10-man Slovan Bratislava. Fredrik Gulbradsen struck twice within seven minutes early in the game to lead Molde to a 3-2 win over Legia Warsaw in the Norwegian team's first competitive game of the year.

210,Cardiff City 0-2 Preston North End: Emil Riis scores first goal since October 2022 in Lilywhites win,https://www.skysports.com/football/cardiff-vs-preston/report/485063,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Preston moved to within two points of the Sky Bet Championship's top six courtesy of a 2-0 win at Cardiff. Emil Riis scored his first goal since October 2022 in the 30th minute before Ben Whiteman struck his third of the campaign to double the away side's lead 10 minutes later. Cardiff struggled to create clear-cut openings and have now lost three home games in succession, while Preston stretched their unbeaten run to three outings. Erol Bulut handed full debuts to former Celtic midfielder David Turnbull and Liverpool loanee Nat Phillips while Ryan Lowe stuck with the same 11 that started Preston's 3-2 success against Ipswich last time out. The Bluebirds started on the front foot and saw Kion Etete and Karlan Grant both drill efforts straight at home goalkeeper Freddie Woodman. The Lilywhites struggled to get into the contest as Cardiff played with more composure and accuracy, with Grant again testing Woodman. But Preston stunned the home crowd by taking the lead with what was their first effort on target on the half hour mark. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Riis cut in from the left flank, evading challenges from Dimitrios Goutas and Manolis Siopis, before firing past Jak Alnwick. It was the Danish forward's first goal since returning from a year on the sidelines due to an ACL injury, and one that allowed Preston to gain a foothold in the game for the first time. The outlook of the match completely shifted, so much so that Bulut was yellow carded by referee Dean Whitestone as the frustration among those in blue grew. It got even better for Preston five minutes before the break as Brad Potts, Will Keane and Mads Frokjaer-Jensen combined on the right and the latter teed up Whiteman, who slotted home to round off a stunning team move. Home fans jeered as the half-time whistle blew and Bulut replaced Ryan Wintle and Josh Bowler with Aaron Ramsey and Josh Wilson-Esbrand for the second half. It was Ramsey's first appearance since suffering a knee injury against Swansea in mid-September, while it was Wilson-Esbrand's maiden home outing for Cardiff since joining on loan from Manchester City. Phillips and Siopis both had efforts shortly after the restart as the Bluebirds looked to reduce Preston's deficit, with Grant then lashing over following a one-two with Ramsey. Famara Diedhiou replaced Etete to make his home bow, although Alnwick did brilliantly to keep Cardiff in the game by palming away Riis' strike. Rubin Colwill and Yakou Meite were both summoned from the bench but Preston managed the final stages with minimal fuss to end their five-game winless away streak, leaving Cardiff seven points adrift of the play-off places in the process. Cardiff's Erol Bulut: ""We need patience, all of us. We've got new players, four or five new players. ""We try to get them adapted to the team quickly. I thought Nat was quite good, Wilson came in, but they have to know their team-mates much better and their movements. ""This will come over the next few games. We have many games in the next few weeks and we have to show it. ""We have to continue to show them what they need to do. I hope the next few games will be much better."" Preston's Ryan Lowe: ""We've all been waiting for Emil to come back. He looked strong physically, I'm pleased with his goal, for him and his team-mates, they're all pleased for him. ""The build-up to it was fantastic and the way he took it, so I'm really pleased for him. It's huge to have him back. ""At some point he's going to have to have a break. We're just trying to mould him into a perfect striker. But we do need to be careful with him. ""We can't just slog him all the way through, we'll manage his days and his loads. ""I'm just pleased for him getting on the scoresheet today after having that long period of time out, as a striker it's pleasing.""

Mbappe is committed to telling the club first if he decides to leave and sign for Real Madrid but that had not happened as of Saturday evening. It would not be a surprise if he moves to Madrid and PSG have contingency plans for all eventualities. Madrid would have to make him the highest-paid player in their history for him to move. There have been multiple reports in France and Spain since the start of the year that Mbappe will leave, with more surfacing on Saturday, but nothing has been communicated to PSG. The France international scored the opener in Paris Saint-Germain's 2-1 win at Strasbourg on Friday night. Mbappe looked set to sign for Real Madrid in May 2022 until he made a dramatic u-turn and signed an expensive new two-year deal at PSG which prompted LaLiga to file a complaint to UEFA that the French club had broken FFP rules. But his relationship with the Ligue 1 side soured last summer after Mbappe told PSG he would not be triggering the clause in his current deal that would extend it until the summer of 2025, meaning he would become a free agent in 2024. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mbappe was frozen out of the first team and not included in the club's pre-season tour after turning down the opportunity to go to Saudi club Al Hilal for a world-record transfer fee of £259m. However, there was another twist on the eve of the new season when Mbappe was reinstated following ""very constructive and positive discussions"", with club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi saying, ""Kylian is committed to PSG"".

212,Swansea City 0-1 Plymouth Argyle: Morgan Whittaker scores on return as Pilgrims finally win away,https://www.skysports.com/football/swansea-vs-plymouth/report/485059,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Morgan Whittaker scored the only goal against former club Swansea to give Plymouth their first away victory of the season. The striker - who left the Swans in a £1million move in July last year - scored in the 18th minute to give the Pilgrims a 1-0 win. It was Whittaker's 17th goal of a profitable season and his ninth in his last 10 games as Argyle made it six games without defeat. Back-to-back Championship defeats and a fourth loss in a row in all competitions leaves Swansea head coach Luke Williams still searching for his first league win since he took charge. It also leaves the Swans just five points clear of the relegation zone. Liam Cullen struck the bar late on, but Swansea lacked accuracy in front of goal and missed several good chances. Both clubs had been active on transfer deadline day and their respected line- ups reflected their work. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports Swansea duo Przemyslaw Placheta and Charles Sagoe Jr were among their substitutes, while Ronald - who joined the club earlier in the week - was given his first start. For Plymouth, Lino Sousa - like Sagoe Jr, an Arsenal loanee - was named on the bench. After Swansea's Ben Cabango had spurned an early chance by lashing a shot high and wide from the edge of the six-yard box, Whittaker gave early indications of his threat. The deep-lying striker's opening gambit was thwarted when Nathan Wood blocked a shot, before Whittaker tested Carl Rushworth with a stinging volley the Swansea keeper just about managed to tip over. From the corner, Plymouth fashioned a goal. Adam Forshaw started the move and then found Whittaker with a pass which the striker clipped nonchalantly, first-time, low into the corner from the edge of the box. Swansea had already felt an injustice when a penalty appeal for a push on Ollie Cooper was turned down, but their failure to level before half-time lay with themselves. New signing Ronald - a £1.5m buy from Brazilian club Gremio Anapolis - twice set up his team-mates from the right wing, but neither chance was taken. Firstly, Jamie Paterson skied his shot over the bar. Then, Jerry Yates allowed Plymouth keeper Conor Hazard to save after the Swans striker met another accurate Ronald cross into the goalmouth. It was the same story at the start of the second half as Yates mis-directed his header wide of the near post from the Brazilian's delivery. If Argyle were riding their luck a little, they were also still looking dangerous enough to improve their lead on the counter-attack. Just before the hour mark, Mickel Miller fired over the bar after two team-mates had shots blocked in a frantic few seconds. Swans' substitute Placheta looked lively after coming on for his debut, but when the Polish winger created space for himself on the edge of the box, his effort was well clear of the bar. Placheta then crossed for fellow substitute Cullen, but the striker was unable to beat Hazard from close range. Swansea were now building a head of steam as Plymouth tired and came nearest to an equaliser when Cullen's dipping shot struck the top of the crossbar in the 84th minute. Hazard also saved from substitute Charlie Patino in the third minute of added time. Swansea's Luke Williams: ""I am frustrated that we didn't turn really good actions into goals. When you create 19 chances and at least four of them are in the six-yard box, there's not an excuse to not win the game. ""What is it that's wrong with those chances? For me, nothing. It's just concentration, finish the action correctly and we'll win the game of football. ""The goal we conceded, we lose concentration again from a long ball forward. Whittaker hits the shot that leads to the corner. Then, from the corner we switch off, the player gets blocked and it's a good strike. ""It's unfair that he (Ronald) doesn't have at least one assist. We tried to make it clear what his role is. ""We have had a few guys to interpret on the training pitch and I am really happy because he didn't try to do his own thing or show off. ""He just tried to play in the game I asked him to play it - so much energy, so many runs in behind. So many players don't want to do that because it's hard, you have to keep sprinting and then you have to provide for someone else. ""I want him to feed the striker. I am happy with him. ""I don't like that (relegation situation), of course I don't like that. We need to concentrate on trying to play really well. ""If we can create 19 chances every week and create openings in the six-yard box, we'd have to be a very unlucky team to suffer more. ""We have some tough fixtures but that's the job. There's no sulking or feeling sorry for myself."" Plymouth's Ian Foster: ""In my short time at the club, we have had to find a way of winning on the road. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices in order to do that. ""Our challenge is to maintain the attacking threat we have but from a really solid defensive structure. ""That was probably a perfect performance today in terms of doing that. ""Of course at times we have to get better with the ball, but we have to start somewhere. We have to get the points on the board. ""I have worked with Morgan in the England pathway, so I know what he is capable of. ""I took him and his partner for breakfast on Wednesday, the day after the club turned down a bid for him from Lazio. ""It was just to see how he is and see what we can do to help him and keep him focussed on his game. ""It's my job to continue to develop him into the player we all hope he can be.""

214,Kilmarnock 1-0 Livingston: Marley Watkins' late strike sees hosts to Scottish Premiership win,https://www.skysports.com/football/kilmarnock-vs-livingston/report/487736,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Kilmarnock left it late to claim a crucial 1-0 victory over Livingston in the Scottish Premiership at Rugby Park. The visitors failed to convert a number of chances in the first half against their out-of-sorts hosts and they were punished at the death. Substitute Kevin van Veen was the provider, knocking the ball across goal for Marley Watkins to bundle home two minutes from time. Killie strengthened their grip on fourth spot after winning their first league match of the year, while Livingston's miserable winless run has stretched to 17, meaning they remain six points adrift at the foot of the table. Greg Stewart was handed his first start for Kilmarnock and Liam Donnelly replaced Liam Polworth as Derek McInnes made two changes to the team that drew with Motherwell four days earlier. Livingston made four changes as they looked to taste victory in the Premiership for the first time since October. Tete Yengi started in the Premiership for the first time, while Daniel MacKay, Steven Bradley and Michael Nottingham all returned to the side. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Bradley had a weak early shot from distance smothered by Will Dennis, while Kyle Vassell blazed high and wide of the target at the other end. The visitors passed up a good opportunity after 20 minutes when Nottingham rose to meet Bradley's free-kick, though his header sailed harmlessly into the arms of the Killie keeper. It required an important intervention from Jamie Brandon to turn Stuart Findlay's dangerous cross behind for a corner - but the home supporters were growing increasingly frustrated at the laboured tempo of their team. Livingston had the ball in the net six minutes before the break after MacKay raced on to Yengi's defence-splitting pass and rolled the ball home, only to have his celebrations cut short by the offside flag. On the stroke of half-time, Scott Pittman curled an effort just wide with Dennis scrambling and Yengi then prodded wide after being brilliantly set free by Bradley. The home fans voiced their displeasure at the end of the first half and McInnes reacted by making a double change at the break. Matty Kennedy replaced Tom Davies and Polworth came on for David Watson. Shamal George had been a virtual spectator but came up with a brilliant stop five minutes into the second half as he leapt to tip away Kennedy's goal-bound shot. The Livi keeper was at it again on the hour mark, sensationally keeping out Donnelly's close-range header. The home supporters were lifted by the introduction of Van Veen on 71 minutes, part of a triple switch by the hosts. Killie survived a huge scare when Mo Sangare passed up a glorious chance after being picked out by Andrew Shinnie. The Lions almost paid the price for their lack of cutting edge when Murray found Watkins with a pinpoint cross, though he was the latest to be denied by more heroics from George. Kennedy stung the palms of the keeper before the hosts finally made the breakthrough with two minutes left. Van Veen did well to nod Kennedy's cross into the path of Watkins who turned the ball into the net. Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: ""We're not going to be in a rush to watch the game back again, but a late winner is always so welcome - sometimes they are the best ones. ""I told the players to enjoy it because it wasn't enjoyable - but enjoy winning the game. ""We struggled for any fluency, we gave the ball away, chose the wrong option and lacked confidence - which was strange as we'd only lost one in 10. ""We'll take that but we need to learn from it, as the season goes on there will be a little bit more pressure on each game."" Livingston manager David Martindale: ""I thought defensively we were very, very good in the shape - we defended very well. ""I felt we had the better chances in the game, I felt tonight was probably more on the offensive players at the club if I'm being brutally honest. ""I don't believe performances alone are enough to make it turn but there are very few performances that I've came in worried. ""I'm frustrated for the players more so than me because I can feel the anxiety and frustration in the changing room."" The attention now turns to the Scottish Cup with a fifth round on Saturday.

Salah suffered the injury while on international duty with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations, coming off at half-time in the 2-2 draw with Ghana in January. The forward was initially diagnosed with a strain in his posterior muscle, with the Egypt Football Federation saying he would only be absent for two matches. However, Salah's injury was worse than first feared, with a further scan then revealing a ""proper tear"" in his hamstring, ruling the 31-year-old out of action for nearly a month. Liverpool have coped well without Mohamed Salah so far but the loss of his increased creativity could yet prove a problem. Klopp, though, has provided a positive update on Salah's condition. ""Mo is going in the right direction. We hope - but we don't know - that he can be a part of training next week. If you ask him, it's next week,"" said the German in his pre-match press conference ahead of Burnley's visit to Anfield on Saturday afternoon.

Liverpool fixtures Latest Liverpool news Live Premier League table Download the Sky Sports App Salah has enjoyed another impressive campaign for the Reds, with his 18 goals and nine assists in all competitions - including a Premier League-high 14 goals so far this season - helping to maintain the club's push for a historic quadruple. Liverpool will also be without Thiago Alcantara against Burnley on Saturday after the Spain midfielder sustained a muscle injury in his five-minute substitute appearance in the 3-1 loss at Arsenal last weekend, in his first appearance since April. ""Thiago is not cool,"" Klopp added. ""He showed a lot of things in training on LFCTV and looked outstanding, so we took him, let him play for a few minutes. ""It's a muscle issue, we don't know the extent yet, but it's not cool. Not good news for him or us. ""It's not a big, big injury, but not good at the moment."" Klopp, however, did not know whether Dominik Szoboszlai would be fit for this month's Carabao Cup final after the Hungary midfielder aggravated a hamstring problem which caused him to miss most of January. ""Dom is running outside at the moment but is not ready for [Saturday],"" Klopp added. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's pretty much the same injury as he had before, obviously it's really not good that he got that again. ""We are fighting for days, if you want. Is it Brentford? Is it the final [against Chelsea on February 25], or is it after the final? I don't know at the moment."" After the 3-1 defeat at Arsenal last Sunday, only their second loss this season, Klopp said he had no problems in lifting his players for the visit of 19th-placed Burnley in front of the ground's biggest attendance of 60,000, with all but a small part of the refurbished Anfield Road stand was now open. However, he stressed they had to ignore the visitors' form which has left them seven points from Premier League safety. ""From the outside world it is probably a proper banana skin. For a sportsperson it is probably not as it is an opponent we respect a lot,"" he added.

""I forgave him for that a long time [ago]. If there are players I should hate, Arjen Robben is one of them,"" said Klopp, referring to the then Bayern Munich winger's 89th-minute winner against his Borussia Dortmund side in the 2013 Champions League final.

The Reds were beaten 3-1 at the Emirates to cut their lead at the top of the Premier League to two points. Liverpool were architects of their own downfall at times, especially for Gabriel Martinelli's second-half goal when Van Dijk and Alisson's mistakes allowed him to score. Jurgen Klopp's side were unable to recover from that moment - questionable defending allowing Leandro Trossard to score an Arsenal third - and Keane was critical of their defensive performance. ""In terms of the intensity from the first whistle to the last whistle from Liverpool, I can't believe how bad they were,"" he said on Super Sunday. ""Credit to Arsenal, they turned up and were at it. But Liverpool defensively, the goals they gave away - it was like a pub team defending. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Defenders are making the game complicated now. Just head that ball - it really is straightforward. Arsenal 3-1 Liverpool report Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW ""We like players being laid back and casual, but I don't. Switch on, smell the danger, head the ball. At centre-half, if in doubt, head the ball. ""I was disappointed with what Liverpool did today, but if you step back, it's their second defeat [of the Premier League season]. I'm pretty sure they'll react because they're a top-quality side, but we expected more today. ""Instead of maybe being too critical of Liverpool, as poor as they were, we have to give that bit of credit to Arsenal. Maybe because they had to win it, they wanted it more."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville on Martinelli goal:


""When the goalkeeper is coming out, he's got a far better sight of it. He has to make contact and clear everything. It was so surprising to see two world-class players make such a mistake.


""They've been outstanding all season, Alisson and Van Dijk, so they're allowed one. Today, it summed up Liverpool.


""That edge wasn't there. When you're told Arsenal could be out of the title race and you can go eight points clear, Arsenal had that little bit more intensity.


""Sometimes, you can't quite describe it as a player but you're missing that little bit extra in your game. When you don't, you get found out and Arsenal have got their rewards today for being a little bit more up for it than Liverpool were."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After the game, Van Dijk recognised the mistake he had made, telling Sky Sports: ""It was a tough day. ""I take full responsibility for the 2-1 [goal] and that's a big turning point in the game. I should have done better and made a better decision there. ""It hurts for me and it hurts for the rest of the team. Especially for me. After the break, we were so good and had opportunities. We were dominant and the atmosphere here became more nervous. ""The turning point was my responsibility. I should have just cleared it. When you make the wrong decision in a split second, these things happen in football. ""These things don't happen too many times in my career but it's a tough one. I will recover from it and learn from things that don't go well. ""But I will take responsibility."" It was another scathing assessment from former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher. He added while Van Dijk and Alisson have often inspired Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table, they were at fault on Sunday. ""[For the Arsenal second goal] Van Dijk just has to head it. Don't let it bounce. We're talking schoolboy stuff here. We're talking about players at the top level. This is something you learn at the bottom level of football,"" he said on Super Sunday. ""Martinelli nudges him slightly into the goalkeeper which puts Alisson off slightly but Martinelli is well within his rights to knock them and clash them together. Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher on Super Sunday:
""I wasn't surprised by Arsenal and how they came at Liverpool in the first half as they almost had to win this game. It had become desperate for them to get back into the race.


""I was watching Liverpool thinking they should just get it into their front players in the first 15 minutes. Not worry about playing the modern football, playing it around the back, but it just played into Arsenal's hands."" ""There's always a chance of that happening if you let the ball bounce. ""There are very few weaknesses in Van Dijk's game but one of them is he has a tendency to hold his position too much. ""Van Dijk and Alisson have been brilliant this season, it's one of the reasons why they're back but that was a howler. ""Van Dijk is involved in all three goals and has made poor decisions. On the first goal, he's stepped in when he should have just stayed where he was, on the second he should have head it and for the third he should have come across.""

Klopp questioned the decision, telling Sky Sports: ""A lot of things were against us today. This referee gave me a red card against Man City for wrestling situation between Bernardo Silva and Mo Salah. Today, same situation with Jota but didn't get a red card. ""It is unbelievable, then the of holding Havertz on Konate for the first yellow card. Then Havertz goes down and the referee gives Konate a yellow card.

When asked if leaving Nunez on the bench was a mistake, Klopp added: ""Maybe. But I understand it. ""We did not play enough football. We were not involved in the game enough, we wanted Trent more on the wing. ""Would I do it again like that? Yes."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Arsenal manager Arteta, he was understandably pleased how his team navigated a sometimes difficult game to launch themselves back into title contention. He told Sky Sports: ""Especially with the performance we had in the first half and the chances we created, the way we conceded was painful. ""We could not feel sorry for ourselves, we needed to react and there was a lot to play for and we went out and suffered a bit. ""They were attacking open spaces and that is a bad thing to concede against them. They changed their shape and we had to bring a player inside. ""Basically the message was there wads going to be difficult moments and we had to navigate through them moments. ""We were ruthless when we had a chance and it feels like a big win. It gives us momentum [in the title race] and the way we have done it we are back on it - really excited."" There were scenes of wild celebration from Arsenal fans and players alike at full-time, but Gary Neville said it did not look like a team who thought they would win the league. The Sky Sports pundit explained: ""The celebrations from Arsenal at the end weren't of a team who thought they are going to go on and win the title. They were of a team who didn't want to be out of a title race. ""That was the relief that we saw at the end. I think Arsenal, when I watch them, are a better team than Liverpool but Liverpool are more ruthless in the final third. ""I said at the start of the season that Arsenal would win the league, but it might cost them at the end. There are so many signs and so many examples of Arsenal not having that killer instinct in that part of the pitch. ""At some point, that's going to hurt them. For me, they're a really well-coached team, their way of play is good but that really important last bit... Liverpool have got so much threat and in the end I think that will be a problem.""

218,Everton 2-2 Tottenham: Jarrad Branthwaite's late equaliser denies Richarlison after double at former club,https://www.skysports.com/football/everton-vs-tottenham/report/482817,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,"Jarrad Branthwaite scored a stoppage-time equaliser to earn Everton a 2-2 draw with Tottenham. Richarlison had twice put Spurs in front against his former club in the first half as Jack Harrison's goal appeared to have been in vain. But Sean Dyche's side conjured up an unlikely point thanks to Branthwaite's rescue act in the 94th minute. Everton are now without a win in six Premier League games dating back to before Christmas but this was a precious point. However, the Toffees stay 18th in the bottom three after Luton's 4-4 draw at Newcastle. Tottenham remain fourth but missed the chance to move further clear of fifth-placed Aston Villa. Everton: Pickford (6), Godfrey (6), Tarkowski (7), Branthwaite (8), Mykolenko (7), Young (6), McNeil (6), Garner (7), Gueye (8), Harrison (6), Calvert-Lewin (6).



Subs: Coleman (6), Chermiti (n/a), Beto (n/a), Dobbin (n/a).



Tottenham: Vicario (6), Porro (7), Romero (7), Van de Ven (8), Udogie (7), Hojbjerg (5), Bentancur (6), Maddison (7), Johnson (6), Richarlison (8), Werner (6).



Subs: Sarr (6), Kulusevski (5), Skipp (n/a), Gil (n/a), Dragusin (n/a).



Man of the match: Jarrad Branthwaite. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For much of the afternoon it had looked like Richarlison's day as he stepped up in the absence of Heung-Min Son. His impact was almost instant, volleying the ball left-footed past Jordan Pickford after Destiny Udogie's clever run found space down the left channel. Everton pushed hard for much of the first half that followed, peppering the penalty box with crosses. Not all of them were accurate but it was enough to unsettle Guglielmo Vicario in the Tottenham goal and that uncertainty brought the equaliser. Harrison was assigned to the goalkeeper and put him off enough to prevent an effective clearance from a right-wing corner. James Tarkowski centred the ball with his head at the back post and Calvert-Lewin nodded in from near the line, via Harrison's leg. Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Enter Richarlison, again, with the right foot this time. James Maddison did well to set him up but there was so much to do. He made it look easy, curling the ball into the far corner. Another muted celebration against his former club. Another merciless finish. Everton were unable to generate the same pressure for much of the second half, Spurs coming closer to extending their lead with Jordan Pickford busier. The England goalkeeper saved well when tested from distance by Pedro Porro and Maddison. Youssef Chermiti did have a good chance to equalise from a cross by fellow substitute Lewis Dobbin but that looked to be that until Branthwaite headed in at the back post from a left-wing free-kick. The spirit of the Blues and a vital point, but Spurs will rue this. ""Very pleased, I suppose from top to bottom, really,"" said Dyche. ""The commitment to the cause was evident and some of the quality. They started well, scored a very good goal and that kind of gave us a kick-start. We went front foot and took the game on with a lot more intent. I thought we played very well. ""We had to keep going into the second half. It had to be the same and it was, I thought we kept the levels really high. I thought we deserved at least an equaliser."" The Everton boss was asked whether his team had specifically targeted goalkeeper Vicario given the volume of crosses going into the six-yard box but he said that was not the case. ""We want to be competitive on set-pieces across the pitch,"" added Dyche. ""My analysts spent a lot of time working on the best way to create chances. There was an intent to score a goal and I think that is evident. We do look a threat. It is just the way we work. We are aware of the opposition, of course, but it is about what we do."" ""It is obviously a difficult place to come and play and dominate and for the most part I thought we handled it okay,"" said Postecoglou afterwards. ""Started the game really well, lost a bit of our composure. Second half was okay, created some good chances, probably needed a third to kill the game off. ""I think we needed another goal. In the last 10 minutes, it's almost inevitable you will be put under pressure here. We had the opportunities. The keeper made some good saves that kept them in the game. We have to take it on the chin and move on."" Vicario received plenty of attention from the Everton players and there were complaints about Harrison's goal, although Postecoglou stopped short of criticising the officials. ""It just seems to be in general referees are reluctant to call these now and leave it to VAR."" Asked if it disappointing to concede from set plays, he added: ""Just as disappointing to concede any goal. There were about 30 set-pieces. It is stuff you have to deal with."" The chief positive was the performance of Richarlison. ""Richy was good again, not just his goals, his general play was really important, he worked hard for the team. There is more to come from Richy."" Everton visit Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League next Saturday; kick-off 12.30pm. Tottenham host Brighton on the same day at 3pm.

219,Maddy Cusack: Family of deceased Sheffield United Women footballer 'welcome' Jonathan Morgan sacking,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13064473/maddy-cusack-family-of-deceased-sheffield-united-women-footballer-welcome-jonathan-morgan-sacking,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Maddy Cusack's family have said they ""welcome"" the sacking of Sheffield United Women's head coach Jonathan Morgan. The Blades announced on Friday that Morgan's contract had been terminated ""due to new information that has come to light within the last few days with regards to Mr Morgan's conduct before arriving at Bramall Lane."" His dismissal is not related to the Football Association investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of former Sheffield United player Cusack. Cusack died aged 27 in September last year. A week after her death, her family are understood to have sent a written complaint to United outlining a range of issues she had been facing, which they claim all stemmed from her relationship with Morgan. Following Morgan's departure from Bramall Lane, the Maddie Cusack Foundation said in a short statement posted on X: ""On Friday afternoon, we learnt on social media of the departure of Jonathan Morgan. We as a family welcome this development. ""We would like to take this opportunity to say thank you for the unwavering loyalty, support and love shown to Maddy from football clubs from around the country and fans alike. We truly appreciate this."" Morgan's now former representatives, Tongue Tied Management, said they had severed ties with him in a statement on Friday. It read: ""In the last 24 hours we have learnt new information regarding Jonathan Morgan and a relationship with a player under his charge. ""We will no longer be working with him in any capacity and the termination of our relationship is with immediate effect. ""The termination of this contract is a critical measure in preserving the integrity of our agency."" Morgan was in charge of Leicester's women's first team from 2014-2021 before moving to Burnley and was appointed by Sheffield United in February 2023. The PA news agency has contacted Sheffield United, Leicester and Burnley for comment. Morgan is a member of the League Managers' Association, which has also been approached for comment. The FA investigation into the circumstances surrounding Cusack's death remains ongoing, PA understands. United commissioned a third-party investigation following the Cusack family's complaint, which concluded last year with no evidence found of any wrongdoing by anyone connected to the club. The FA announced on January 8 it was assessing information surrounding the circumstances of Cusack's death, but stressed at that time it had not opened a formal investigation. PA understands that changed last week, when the FA told the family at a meeting on January 24 that it was formally investigating. Morgan stepped away from his post in October after the independent investigation commissioned by the club started but returned to work at United in the final week of last year. PA has contacted the FA and Professional Footballers' Association for comment."

221,"Premier League hits and misses: Luton thrill, woe for Crystal Palace and Sheff Utd, while Tottenham blow lead",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/13062913/premier-league-hits-and-misses-luton-thrill-woe-for-crystal-palace-and-sheff-utd-while-tottenham-blow-lead,Author not found,Publish time not found," Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ange Postecoglou was downbeat after seeing his side drop two points in stoppage time and that late failing risks undermining their impressive performances this season. Tottenham have now conceded eight goals after the clock has struck 89 minutes. That is more than any other team in the Premier League this season and more than Spurs have conceded in any full campaign in the competition's history, which is a particularly worrying statistic. Especially given that this was the first-choice defence. Sean Dyche insisted that Guglielmo Vicario had not been specifically targeted but expect teams to do so now. Nathan Ake bundled in the winner against them for Manchester City in the FA Cup in startingly similar fashion - that goal coming in the 88th minute. It is 27 goals conceded in 15 Premier League games now. Spurs are entertaining and that matters, engendering a feeling of optimism under Postecoglou. But expect the man himself to want to see his team be more clinical at both ends to win games like this one.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Crystal Palace are at a crossroads. For so long, mid-table stability, combined with developing a smattering of exciting young players, has been enough for the south Londoners. Much of that stability has been provided by Steve Parish, whose backing helped to bring the club up from the Championship, and Roy Hodgson, who has done so much across two spells to keep the Eagles in the Premier League. Live Premier League table Watch free Premier League highlights Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports But now many of the supporters want more. Shorn of Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise for much of the season, Palace have slipped to just five points above the relegation zone, while winning just two of their last 14 games. Hodgson's side have conceded nine goals in their last two away games, both of which saw fans turn on Parish and the board. January's investment in Adam Wharton and Daniel Munoz doesn’t appear to have placated the fanbase. With Hodgson aged 76 and only having a contract until the end of the season, a change in the dugout is surely coming sooner rather than later. But what then? Palace have the 12th-highest net spend over the past five seasons and have been missing arguably their three best players - Eze, Olise and Cheikh Doucoure - for huge chunks of the campaign. Is it fair to ask them to be achieving any more than they already are? Palace supporters may want to be careful what they wish for.Joe Shread Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  David Datro Fofana was fighting a one-man battle at times to carry Burnley to an unlikely point against Fulham. Aside from scoring both goals, he had as many opposition-box touches as anyone on the pitch except Wilson Odobert, registered the highest xG on the pitch by more than double, and still found time to make two tackles - another match high. He was even good enough to give everyone else an hour-long head start before his introduction on the hour. His 30-minute cameo won't live long in the memory outside of Turf Moor but it is certainly more important than the draw he can claim he earned on his own. Burnley have been lacking an X factor in the final third all season. Now they have it. Fofana is direct, he is explosive, he is physical. How he only scored once at Union Berlin in the first half of the season is a mystery, because he is Premier League quality. He proved it at Manchester City in midweek, where he was given another half hour to impress and made Ameen Al-Dakhil's late consolation and finally gave Josko Gvardiol something of a test. He was unlucky not to start after that cameo. It would be gobsmacking if he is not on the team sheet at Liverpool next weekend. Burnley have both the second-worst attack and defence in the Premier League - so sitting 19th in the table feels exactly right. But it shows Fofana's immediate impact that he can score one 12th of their season tally in less than one half of football. No-one expects him to repeat that goalscoring form from now until May but there are signs that he can provide the energy and quality in the final third that has been lacking. That, coupled with the defensive additions of Maxime Esteve, who himself enjoyed a steady debut from the bench, and Lorenz Assignon, who assisted his first goal, can give Burnley hope. And with a seven-point gap to safety, that's about all anyone can ask right now.Ron Walker Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There is no coincidence that Luton's fortunes have taken a significant upgrade since Chiedozie Ogbene came back into the side. With Issa Kabore on international duty, Ogbene has been handed his chance as the right wing-back in Luton's fluid 3-4-3 formation. Although capable of mucking in and doing his duties without the ball, his strengths are when the play turns over and he can stretch his legs. And boy can he stretch his legs. His direct running and added attacking outlet down the right has seen Luton go unbeaten in the six matches Ogbene has played. In that period, they have scored 13 goals, including eight in their last two Premier League encounters. He's had a huge influence in both the 4-0 win over Brighton and this 4-4 draw with Newcastle. In total across his 180 minutes of action, he made eight successful dribbles. Dan Burn won't be sleeping well tonight having had his head spun by Ogbene's wizardry and speed with the ball. It was Burn's foul on Ogbene that handed Luton the penalty that took them 3-2 up. Only Michael Olise, Jeremy Doku, Luca Koleosho and Mohammed Kudus average more successful dribbles per 90 this season than Ogbene (2.74) now. He is among the elite. A real livewire.Lewis Jones Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After 23 games of last season, Newcastle had only conceded 15 goals, the fewest in the Premier League by a street. This time around, the goals against column reads 37. Never has their defensive collapse been more apparent than in Saturday's bewilderingly open 4-4 draw with Luton. Rob Edwards' side were rewarded for their boldness. But it is hardly surprising they went for it. Newcastle's vulnerabilities are obvious. Until fairly recently, their struggles were at least limited to their away games. Not anymore. Following 3-2 and 3-1 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest respectively, they have now conceded 10 goals in their last three Premier League clashes at St James' Park. Luton were able to hurt them in multiple ways, through the speed of Chiedozie Ogbene against Dan Burn on the right flank, through the time and space afforded to Ross Barkley in midfield, though the set-piece threat which Newcastle failed to negate. And yet the back four that started Saturday's game is the same as the one that excelled for so much of last season. It is not a simple question of personnel, it is systemic. There are gaps right across midfield. The pressing is disjointed. The confidence is shot. The fact they were able to claw their way back from two goals down shows their fighting spirit remains. But a season of strife could yet get worse if their defensive issues are not resolved. Right now, it is difficult to see a straightforward solution.Nick Wright  If defending is an artform, Sheffield United have produced crimes against it this season. This latest walloping at the hands of an Aston Villa, who should've been vulnerable after a midweek 3-1 home defeat to Newcastle, means the Blades have now shipped 59 Premier League goals in 23 games. That average of 2.56 goals shipped per game means this Blades defence is officially the worst defence in Premier League history, at this stage of the season. No team has conceded more after 23 games. The underlying metrics back up that stark record. The Blades have faced the most shots (390) and have the highest expected goals against (46.07) figure this season. Any momentum gained by appointing club legend Chris Wilder has disappeared into the abyss. He hasn't helped himself at times, either, in the search for cohesion in his backline. In nine Premier League games in charge, he's named six different defensive line-ups. He doesn't know his best XI - and neither did his predecessor Paul Heckingbottom. The planning must start now for next season back in the Championship.Lewis Jones You can now start receiving messages and alerts for the latest breaking sports news, analysis, in-depth features and videos from our dedicated WhatsApp channel!

Media in Guardiola's homeland claim the Norwegian would be open to a switch to the Spanish capital in the summer, with Real prepared to activate a release fee - despite also having an interest in Paris St-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe. However, Guardiola was unruffled by the speculation, instead revealing Haaland could start the Monday Night Football trip to Brentford, which is live on Sky Sports. ""He's ready,"" Guardiola said with a smile when asked about whether Haaland could build on his substitute cameo against Burnley with a starting spot at the Gtech Community Stadium. Haaland had been out since early December with a foot problem. Addressing the transfer speculation the day after Deadline Day for the winter window, Guardiola said: ""I don't know, you have to ask the media from Madrid if [Haaland's camp] are happy. Maybe they have more info than we have. ""I, we, don't have that feeling he's unhappy. He was because he didn't play for two months, injured.

Haaland - City's top scorer during their historic treble-winning campaign last season - is contracted until 2027 after joining the club from Borussia Dortmund for £51.2m in 2022. Despite his time out with injury, Haaland remains joint-top scorer in the Premier League this season with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah on 14 goals. However, he will come up against another highly-rated forward on Monday, with Ivan Toney leading the line for the Londoners. Toney made it two goals in two games since his return from a betting ban with a strike in Brentford's defeat to Tottenham on Wednesday and Guardiola was full of praise for the England international's talents. ""He's an exceptional player,"" said Guardiola. ""Not just with the long balls, with the keeping [of possession], set-pieces, the penalties are a guarantee, with the free-kicks, they can link with him... ""He's an extraordinary player.

225,Sunderland 3-1 Plymouth Argyle: Jobe Bellingham scores as Black Cats come from behind to win,https://www.skysports.com/football/sland-vs-plymouth/report/485072,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Sunderland climbed into the Sky Bet Championship play-off places with an inspired come-from-behind 3-1 victory against Plymouth, who lost for the first time in the league under Ian Foster. Argyle were unbeaten in three Championship games since Foster replaced Steven Schumacher and looked well positioned to continue their fine run when Ryan Hardie fired them into a half-time lead at the Stadium of Light. But the Black Cats were a team transformed after the break, with Pierre Ekwah, Jack Clarke and substitute Jobe Bellingham all on target as Michael Beale's improving side extended their own unbeaten league run to three games. Buoyed by their impressive recent form and their first away win of the season at Swansea, Plymouth settled well and created the only meaningful chance in the early stages when Hardie forced a good save out of Anthony Patterson. Sunderland dominated possession in the opening 45 minutes, but lacked invention, and their only shot on target in the first half was a speculative Clarke effort from distance that was stopped by visiting goalkeeper Conor Hazard. After stifling and frustrating Sunderland for much of the first half, Plymouth caught the hosts cold on the counter to get themselves in front six minutes before the break. In-form Morgan Whittaker turned defence in to attack with a brilliant pass to set Hardie away. The striker still had work to do, but kept his cool to round Patterson twice before clinically and delicately chipping home. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Hardie almost doubled Plymouth's lead instantly with what would have been a stunning second goal. From inside his own half, the striker spotted Patterson off his line and his audacious attempt to catch the keeper out bounced just wide. Sunderland turned the game on its head after the break and were level just seven minutes into the second half. The Black Cats won a free-kick on the edge of the area when Darko Gyabi fouled Patrick Roberts, and former West Ham midfielder Ekwah fired through the broken wall and found the bottom corner. Just seven minutes later, Sunderland were in front after Clarke's latest moment of magic. The winger's 14th goal of the season was undoubtedly one of his best. There was plenty of work to be done when he picked up the ball on the left, but he cut inside before hitting an unstoppable drive that went in off the post. Bellingham secured the victory for Sunderland halfway through the second half and just two minutes after coming off the bench. The teenager had barely touched the ball before setting off on a driving run into the box, cutting inside and lashing into the far corner beyond the helpless Hazard. Sunderland's Michael Beale: ""We only played in one half, to be honest. We started the game well, but we really fell away and there were too many individual errors. ""We went really bold with our line-up and it certainly impacted our cohesion early in the game, I wasn't pleased with our pressing. ""We had honest words at half-time, got out there early and I thought from the moment we kicked off, we were much much better. ""We scored three excellent goals and we're mixing around the goalscorers now as well. It was three special goals."" ""We're a young team and so we always can get better. In that first half, there weren't too many in a Sunderland shirt who did themselves justice and we spoke about that. ""We spoke about wanting to excite our fans at home, to run, play front-foot football and for people to express themselves.

The second half was fantastic and we have to stay at that level."" Plymouth's Ian Foster: ""My understanding is a player has to spend 30 seconds off the pitch, which he did, and they won't allow him on. ""I got told then the fourth official must get a signal from the referee to allow him back on, which he does straight after they score, which is disappointing. ""In that moment, it's become very costly for us. He's got injured, he's received treatment, I don't understand why it's a punishment. ""I'll try and choose my words carefully here, if I was the referee I'd go home disappointed tonight having watched the game back.

226,Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Birmingham City: Ike Ugbo scores twice to give Owls' survival hopes much-needed boost,https://www.skysports.com/football/sheff-wed-vs-birmham/report/485070,Dan Long,Publish time not found,"Sheffield Wednesday gave their dwindling survival hopes a shot in the arm on Friday night as they earned a deserved 2-0 win over Birmingham. Ike Ugbo scored his first goal since joining the Owls on loan from Troyes in January to put Danny Rohl's side in front against the run of play at Hillsborough. The Canada international doubled his tally and the hosts' lead early on in the second half with the decisive touch on a cross from Marvin Johnson. Birmingham - who have now won just one of their last nine league games - racked up a total of 25 shots, but could not find a way past England U20 goalkeeper James Beadle. They stay four points above the bottom three, but firmly in the relegation conversation with 16 games still to play, while Wednesday climb to within five points of safety after their first win since New Year's Day and just their seventh all season. Birmingham were on top from the off and had fashioned four chances inside the first 15 minutes so - given the predictable unpredictability of the Championship - it came as little surprise when Wednesday instead took the lead. Leeds loanee Ian Poveda collected the ball on the right flank, showed neat footwork to lose his man and laid the ball on a plate for Ugbo to guide home the opener against the run of play after 16 minutes How Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham lined up Match stats LIVE Championship table Stream Sky Sports with NOW Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Birmingham kept the chances coming, though, and created an xG figure of 1.01 from 12 shots; Wednesday were living dangerously at the back at times, but trying to beat Beadle became an arduous task. In fact, Poveda and Ugbo each had a chance to extend the Owls' lead before the break, but both fired wide. The hosts' fight did not decrease after the break and they doubled their lead on 53 minutes, when Johnson was afforded time to lift an inviting ball to the far post, where Ugbo leapt above Lee Buchanan to head in. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tony Mowbray's side did manage to create chances after that; Buchanan's sweet strike hit the side netting, before Jordan James ran into traffic and bent a shot just wide of the right-hand post. Ultimately, they faded as the second half progressed. When eight minutes were added on by the fourth official, the Blues momentarily upped their game. Seung-Ho Paik forced a strong save from Beadle and Juninho Bacuna hit a bouncing ball wide, but there was to be no reward.

""It was important, in our situation, it is just one game with three points and there are 15 games. We have to go. ""I am not speaking about momentum, I am speaking about three points, for me it was a first cup final.

227,Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag feels INEOS ambition as Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox eyed for football operation roles,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13072256/man-utd-boss-erik-ten-hag-feels-ineos-ambition-as-dan-ashworth-and-jason-wilcox-eyed-for-football-operation-roles,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Erik ten Hag says he can ""feel the ambition"" at Manchester United as INEOS consider Newcastle's Dan Ashworth and Southampton's Jason Wilcox for the club's new-look structure. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal to acquire a 25 per cent stake in United, which will see INEOS take control of football operations, is expected to be completed next week. After announcing Omar Berrada as the club's new CEO from Man City, INEOS have turned their attentions to hiring Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth to a similar role at Old Trafford, although a deal is not expected to be straightforward. Southampton director of football Wilcox, well-known to Berrada from their time at City, is on United's radar to work alongside Ashworth. The 52-year-old has already made a positive impact behind the scenes at St Mary's after joining last year. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday ahead of facing Luton Town this weekend - live on Sky Sports - Ten Hag said of INEOS: ""You see and you feel that ambition, brings a mood and a spirit. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""The players and staff are aligned with the ambitions of INEOS, that's why we are playing for Manchester United. ""We want to win and achieve the highest. We have to make strategies and execute them to prove the ambitions."" Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Download the Sky Sports Get Sky Sports Player trading has been a key area targeted for improvement by INEOS as they prepare to take control of football operations. Sales have been pinpointed as a concern on top of United's missteps making signings. ""I think it is very important you're on one page with a football philosophy and tactics,"" Ten Hag added. ""About the player profiles, it's important to have very good communication to get the right players. ""Developing a good team means having the right players and the right characters. It is a long process to get the right players in but it's important to get aligned. ""I've worked in several situations where sometimes I was alone in charge, sometimes I had the co-operation. I've dealt with several situations. But it's so specific and so intense that you need people around you who are on the same page, working on the same targets to achieve the high ambitions."" Magpies chief Ashworth is top of Ratcliffe's list to front up his new football operation at Old Trafford, although there is yet to be formal contact between the two clubs. It is understood Ashworth is open to the move and Newcastle would be looking for significant compensation, given he only joined the club two years ago. Man Utd would ideally want him in place this summer to oversee their transfer overhaul as INEOS take control over the football operation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When pressed on whether he would influence the sporting director appointment, Ten Hag added: ""I am here working with the current construction. I'm very happy in this construction so I don't know anything about changes. ""I talk with the sporting organisation but it's not up to me. I'm focused on this team. We're now working on the plans for the summer as the window is shut for January. ""Everything is aligned with each other. We're a club, the first team is not an isolated department. But it's important that the first team is performing and getting results."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interest in Ashworth comes after the Premier League and the Football Association both approved Ratcliffe's proposed bid to buy a minority stake in the club. Ten Hag also confirmed defender Luke Shaw is a doubt for the trip to Luton on Sunday, but the Dutchman would not categorically rule the left-back out, adding he would be assessed after being taken off against Aston Villa as a precaution. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has suffered a setback in his rehabilitation, while Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount and Lisandro Martinez remain long-term absentees. On the unique challenge of a trip to Kenilworth Road, Ten Hag said: ""The pitch is smaller or longer? 11 vs 11? No referees are coming? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Of course, every ambience is different, we have to deal with the circumstances. It's about playing football 11 vs 11 - we have to make it our game. ""We are not in a position to underestimate any opponent so we will not. ""We have to play our best because we've seen their performances across the season are really good and they are improving. I have a lot of respect for this team."" Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: ""It is very significant because Jim Ratcliffe is not wasting any time at Manchester United. He's already brought in Sir Dave Brailsford, who's conducting a review of the whole club. He's already appointed Omar Berrada as a new chief executive who used to have a senior role at Manchester City. ""But the key role that fans want filled is this sporting director role because it is no secret in football that Manchester United haven't been performing very well in the transfer market and Dan Ashworth is somebody who has an absolutely brilliant record at West Brom, Brighton and also at Newcastle. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""He also did exceptional work when he was at the Football Association, bringing through a whole new young England team while working very closely with Gareth Southgate. ""He's got a reputation as being the best in the business as far as English football is concerned, and I think it would be a big coup if Manchester United were able to get him from Newcastle. ""Sometimes when it comes to transfers, you can overstate how much one person is responsible for making those signings, so I don't know if Dan Ashworth was responsible for signing Moises Caicedo at Brighton for £4.5m, Kaoru Mitoma for £2.5m and Alexis Mac Allister for around £6m. ""At Newcastle, Bruno Guimaraes, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon - they've made some really good signings. I'm not saying that's all down to Dan Ashworth, but he has been the man in charge, he's been the sporting director, so you have to say when you look at his CV, when you look at his track record and compare it to what has been a real hit and miss sort of recruitment operation at Manchester United recently, you would have to say this is a very positive move if it comes off. ""I've had some dealings with him, especially when he used to work at the Football Association. He's a very impressive character. He knows English football inside out and I think he's also very plugged into the best young English players so maybe we could see United buying them and young players from abroad."" Analysis by Sky Sports News North East reporter Keith Downie: ""You have to remember that although he was appointed in February 2022, the first four or five months of that was spent on gardening leave, so he only really got his feet under the desk at Newcastle in June 2022. ""So he is less than two years into what is a huge rebuilding job at Newcastle, but you would suggest the rebuilding job is even bigger at Man Utd. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""As far as Newcastle is concerned, they would be very reluctant to lose him, he is a huge part of what they are trying to do right now. But like with a player transfer, if an individual agitates to leave and their head is turned, it may be difficult for Newcastle to hold on to him. ""The last thing they would want to do is drag this out. Remember, Dan Ashworth is privy to lots of sensitive transfer information and the noises coming out of the club are that they want this dealt with quickly, they do not want this to drag on. ""But they are now well aware that Man Utd are keen on bringing Ashworth in and they are braced for that formal approach to come, but they will not let Ashworth go without a fight, they will be looking for compensation and it may be that he will have to serve a period of gardening leave like we saw when he joined Newcastle from Brighton as well. ""For Newcastle, it would not be great in terms of optics losing someone of his stature to Man Utd, but sometimes these decisions are out of the hands of the powers that be at football clubs.""

228,Chelsea's record under Mauricio Pochettino is similar to Graham Potter's - so why are results so poor?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13064792/chelseas-record-under-mauricio-pochettino-is-similar-to-graham-potters-so-why-are-results-so-poor,Rob Dorsett,Publish time not found,"Chelsea are in the mire - which is where they have been for more than a year now. Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali's huge investment and equally impressive ambition have so far seen no improvement on the pitch. In fact, judging by the Premier League table alone, the club has gone backwards. Just a reminder, Chelsea finished third in Thomas Tuchel's final season in charge. During Sunday's 4-2 home defeat to Wolves, groups of Chelsea supporters could be heard chanting the name of the club's previous owner, Roman Abramovich. Patience with the new ownership is wearing thin, however admirable the investment and aspiration. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When Clearlake Capital bought the club in May 2022, Chelsea looked upwards and saw only Manchester City and Liverpool above them in the Premier League. But after buying the club for a record £4.25bn, spending significantly more than £1bn on players and staff and after sacking three managers, are Chelsea any better off now than when they removed Graham Potter 10 months ago? Comparisons are timely because Mauricio Pochettino has now had 31 games in charge - the same number of fixtures that Potter managed before he was sacked. Chelsea fixtures Live Premier League table Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Chelsea were 11th in the Premier League table then - exactly where they are now. The records of the two managers are remarkably similar. Both managers lost 11 matches in that period - Pochettino has turned two more draws into wins. But Potter's final five games in charge of Chelsea saw only one defeat and three wins - including one over Borussia Dortmund that took them to the Champions League quarter-finals. Pochettino's last five results have seen two heavy defeats to Wolves and Liverpool, and two wins against Luton and Middlesbrough, though victory over the latter has taken Chelsea into this month's League Cup final. There is no suggestion Pochettino is under any immediate danger of the sack - but Potter was released with a very similar record, despite Boehly stating the former Brighton boss was appointed because he shared the owners' philosophy: to oversee a long-term development project. That project lasted seven months. In all competitions, Pochettino's Chelsea has scored many more goals in those 31 games (54 to Potter's 33), but the team has conceded many more goals too (43 to Potter's 31). Potter's Chelsea kept two more clean sheets (11 to Pochettino's nine), though the team's passing accuracy has improved slightly under the Argentine - 88 per cent pass completion compared with 86 per cent when Potter was in charge. But the ultimate statistic shows that none of Chelsea's three managers appointed by Clearlake have won enough matches. Potter's win percentage was 36 per cent, Frank Lampard's nine per cent and Pochettino's is currently 45 per cent. Lampard's record, sandwiched in between Potter and Poch, was even more disappointing: So why have so many big names struggled to take over the reins at Stamford Bridge? Recruitment has been an obvious, and the biggest, problem. The first thing to point out is Potter, Lampard and Pochettino were not appointed as managers. Their title of 'head coach' hints at how Chelsea's hierarchy works, and how little say the man in charge of the first team has over recruitment and other structures around the first team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Under Pochettino, the club recruited 13 players at a cost of more than £400m in the summer. Under Potter, Chelsea signed £550m-worth of players across two transfer windows. While both Pochettino and Potter were consulted, neither head coach had a significant role to play in the majority of those signings. Chelsea's co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart were appointed a year ago, and the two chiefs have ultimate power over all football matters - talent identification, coaching, recruitment and data analysis. With a host of other senior personnel brought in to work underneath Winstanley and Stewart, Chelsea's recruitment department is the envy of Europe, having been assembled at great expense with some of the brightest talents and biggest names in the football business. But so far, that has not led to improvements on the pitch. The repeated, unprecedented investment in players has led to unfeasibly large squads, if you listen to what the head coaches have said. Both Potter and Pochettino have complained about the sheer number of players they have had to work with. Pochettino said in July there would be a ""mess"" if his 29-man ""unbalanced"" squad was not cut down. At the time, he had four left-backs, but only five natural midfielders. In September, he said: ""I need to be more involved now in all the decisions. I have started to work to identify what we need for January."" In the Potter era, with a squad of 33 senior players, some had to get changed in the corridor because there weren't enough places in the dressing room at their Cobham training ground. Eleven-versus-eleven training games often saw more than a dozen players on the sidelines or practicing in a separate small-sided game. When Chelsea paid more than £100m for Enzo Fernandez 12 months ago, Potter said: ""I found out that we'd signed Enzo when it was all done and I'm very pleased, because he is a fantastic player."" Before his final game in charge last spring, Lampard said: ""The squad has been too big - and that's the biggest challenge I've found day-to-day. [Many players] are a bit disillusioned because they're not playing or might be leaving."" Lampard also said standards generally at the club had dipped: ""I can be honest about that, particularly because it's my last game."" Another issue successive Chelsea head coaches have had to deal with is the sheer amount of structural change at the club - which is still being felt 20 months after the Clearlake takeover. The first team's medical department was overhauled 18 months ago, with several long-term employees replaced, including Paco Biosca who had been in charge at Chelsea since 2011. Injuries plagued Potter's tenure, with 11 first-team players absent at the height of the problems. Pochettino had 12 players on the sidelines earlier this month. While there is no suggestion the changes in medical staff caused or added to those injury problems, it's another example of the widespread changes at Chelsea, which are still bedding in. Potter would also claim mitigation for his poor Chelsea record in the lack of a pre-season to prepare his squad and the interruption of the winter World Cup in Qatar which left him with just four senior players to work with. But it's clear that Pochettino too, is struggling with many of the same issues felt by his predecessor. Results remain stubbornly poor, hugely inferior to what both the Chelsea owners and supporters expect from a team who won the Champions League less than three years ago.

229,Nottingham Forest 2-3 Newcastle: Eddie Howe's side battle to victory to move up to seventh in Premier League,https://www.skysports.com/football/n-forest-vs-newcastle/report/482827,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Newcastle battled to a thrilling 3-2 victory over a spirited Nottingham Forest on Saturday Night Football. After seeing fellow strugglers Luton and Everton lose earlier in the day, Nottingham Forest sensed an opportunity for some breathing space in the battle to beat the drop, but Newcastle had other ideas. Bruno Guimares' smart volley gave the visitors the lead but Forest fought back through Anthony Elanga. In a topsy-turvy first 45 minutes Newcastle restored their advantage through Fabian Schar but again the home side roared back as Callum Hudson-Odoi's deflected strike beat Martin Dubravka to level the scores again. Forest started the second half well and were denied a penalty by referee Anthony Taylor and VAR Tony Harrington when Taiwo Awoniyi went to ground under a challenge from Dubravka. However, it was Newcastle who took the lead for a third time as Guimaraes added his second of the night. Eddie Howe's side, who have now picked up four straight away wins in all competitions for the first time since 2016, didn't repeat the mistakes of earlier in the game and held on for a win that sees them move up to seventh. Meanwhile, Forest, who are now without a win in the league in four games, stay 16th and just two points above the drop zone. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Backed by a hostile atmosphere, Forst were quick out of the traps. They have had plenty of success with counter-attacking football already under Nuno and they should have taken the lead as early as the fifth minute when Nuno Tavares' cut back picked out Gibbs-White, who dragged his strike wide. Despite the quick start from the hosts, it was Newcastle who took the lead. Forest were caught asleep at a corner as Miguel Almiron went short to Kieran Trippier, and the England full-back whipped the ball to the far post for Guimaraes to produce a brilliant volleyed finish. Forest still looked a threat on the break and Martin Dubravka had to be alert to deny Elanga, but the winger made no mistake when presented with a second opportunity in the 26th minute. Gibbs-White's inch-perfect pass released Elanga in behind Dan Burn, and the former Man Utd winger was composed as he slid the ball past an onrushing Dubravka. Nottingham Forest: Sels (6), Williams (6), Niakhate (6), Murillo (7), Tavares (6), Yates (7), Dominguez (7), Elanga (7), Gibbs-White (7), Hudson-Odoi (7), Awoniyi (7).


Subs used:  Origi (6), Reyna (6),  Danilo (n/a).


Newcastle:  Dubravka (7), Trippier (7), Schar (7), Botman (6), Burn (6), Longstaff (7), Guimaraes (8), Miley (6), Almiron (6), Wilson (7), Gordon (7).


Subs used:  Barnes (6), Livramento (n/a), Krafth (n/a).


Player of the match:  Bruno Guimaraes. The momentum felt like it was with Nottingham Forest now, but another defensive lapse undid all their good work. Trippier's free-kick caused problems again and Botman headed the ball back into the danger area before Schar stroked a fine finish into the bottom corner to restore the lead. Forest had to do it all again, but back they came and they had a huge slice of luck as Hudson-Odoi's strike took a huge deflection off Miley. The ball sailed past a helpless Dubravka at his near post to send the sides in at the break level. Forest continued to have joy against Newcastle's high line early in the second half. Yates played in Awoniyi, who took the ball in his stride before finishing superbly from a tight angle, but the offside flag was correctly raised with the striker failing to time his run. The home side then thought they should have had a penalty just after the hour. Awoniyi raced through on goal from Matz Sels' long kick and looked to be tripped by Dubravka's outstretched arm, but referee Taylor waved away the appeals and VAR did not overrule, despite a check. It proved a crucial decision as three minutes later Newcastle went ahead for the third time as Elanga's loose pass went straight to Guimaraes, who found the bottom corner for his second of the night. This time Newcastle did not relinquish their advantage and saw it out for a valuable three points. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports: ""It was another really entertaining game. We came in level at half-time after playing well. We showed good spirit to win the game. ""Big win, great spirit. Especially in the second half. We played well in the first period. We dominated the ball and controlled the game but then came in at 2-2 which was disappointing. Second half was different I thought we won the game based on our determination and unity and spirit. ""Having a couple of options from the bench was massive for us and we haven't had that for a few months. Hopefully everyone came through this one fit because that's going to be key for us."" On chasing the Champions League places: ""We're just trying to win every game we play. We're feeling more ourselves now after these couple of away wins."" Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimaraes to Sky Sports: ""I'm very happy, it's a good game for us. I played with more freedom and felt good. It was important after the draw with Luton last week. We played very well and it was very important for us today. ""For me, we shouldn't have given the ball away, we tried to pass. The second half we played very well. We played with the ball a lot tonight. ""We have to get Europe again. Try for Champions League, I know it's difficult but definitely for Europa League. We have been better away from home this season. We have a big game at home next week and hopefully we can get the three points. ""I enjoy my time here. The fans have been unbelievable for me and my family. I hope this can keep going for a long time."" Forest thought they should have had a penalty when Awoniyi looked to be tripped by Dubravka's outstretched arm, but referee Anthony Taylor did not give a penalty and VAR did not overrule despite a check. Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""I thought this was definitely a penalty. ""It was just a long ball forward and you could see Botman was in trouble with Awoniyi. The striker is falling over, don't get me wrong, but the critical moment when his left foot makes contact with Dubravka's arm. He is losing his footing slight but that's where he loses his balance. There is nowhere he can put his foot. ""I think Newcastle get away with one. ""It's a huge moment in the game. They get a penalty and the chances are they score it. They are then 3-2 up, in the ascendancy and the crowd will be up and right behind them. ""It's a big, big moment."" Sky Sports' Izzy Christiansen:


""Nuno Espirito Santo mentioned after the game that Nottingham Forest create chances, but you have to convert them and score goals.


""Against Newcastle, they did have enough opportunities, but they weren’t clinical enough.


""There is a bit of a worry over them for me because they are also defensively quite leaky.


""Meanwhile, Everton look strong and have a structure. I’d back them to stay up. Luton have found some form in recent weeks, despite the result today. Sheffield United could gain some momentum from beating Luton.


""It leaves Forest in quite a precarious situation. "" Sky Sports' Izzy Christiansen: Everything is happening at speed and that is why I think what has happened has happened. Dubravka's arm definitely makes contact with Awoniyi's boot. You can ask the questions why is he not just staying on his feet and slotting the ball away into an empty net. But because of the pace that this all happens at he cannot stay on his feet. I think it's a penalty missed for Forest. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo to Sky Sports: ""Good performance, we did a lot of things good. Some things bad that really cost us. We didn't defend well the corner for the third goal but overall we played good. The boys fight and we had chances to make a difference."" On penalty decisions against his side: ""It's hard - I'm very polite in these situations. I don't like to interfere too much but when VAR have time to see and check it over and over again they don't see what I see. It happens, let's move on. More important for me is to try and look how we play. We did well, we created a lot of situations. Controlling the game in the second half, playing good. We have to be focussed and look at details. ""Final decision was good, we had one vs ones with the goalkeeper. We are finding the right space but we need to improve on the finishing. ""We've been working very hard, the boys are committed. It's about trying to convert results from spells of good football. And we have to improve defensively."" Sky Sports Andy Hinchcliffe:


""The Brazilian midfielder truly underlined his importance to Newcastle. He's a class act.

In any other season they would be cruising away with the title. Farke knows, however, that he has a significantly more talented squad than the last Leeds side that were in the Championship. He has so much quality to pick from, but the jewel in the crown has been Crysencio Summerville - with 15 goals and eight assists to his name already. At 22, the Dutch midfielder has knuckled down this season after a turbulent summer following relegation at the club, putting in a string of superb performances. Farke has been impressed to say the least.

""To deliver in this league you have to be on it more or less each and every day on the training pitch, and that is what he's doing. ""It is no coincidence that he has provided so many decisive goals and assists. ""We don't have to speak about his potential, because for Cry the sky is the limit. But to show consistency, that is quite crucial."" Another standout player has been Archie Gray, both in terms of performance and his young age. The teenager - who is the fourth member of his family to play for Leeds after his grandfather Frank, great uncle Eddie and father Andy - doesn't turn 18 until next month. But he has played in 30 of their 32 league games this season, and he also performed a seamless switch midway through from midfield to right-back, taking it calmly and adeptly in his stride. Farke, who handed Gray his debut in August, believes all credit belongs to the player for making himself a fixture in the side. ""All the praise has to go to Archie,"" he says. ""You can work with a player, back the player and trust the player, but we can only bring him to the door and he has to make that step through it. ""How he's done that, with the maturity and consistency he has, is outstanding for a 17-year-old. ""He's still unbelievably grounded, humble and has good habits. That is so crucial that you don't get over the moon after just one or two good games or a couple of good months. ""It is so far, so good. But quality is always defined over the long term, and he has to keep going in order to speak about a really quality season. ""I've worked throughout my career with fantastic young players.

233,Sonia Bompastor: Chelsea Women approach Lyon head coach to replace outgoing Emma Hayes,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/37008/13071610/sonia-bompastor-chelsea-women-approach-lyon-head-coach-to-replace-outgoing-emma-hayes,Anton Toloui,Publish time not found,"Chelsea have approached Lyon head coach Sonia Bompastor to become their new manager. Current Blues boss Emma Hayes announced she would be leaving the club at the end of the season to take up a position with the USA national team in November. Negotiations are ongoing but the French coach is the first candidate Chelsea have reached out to. Bompastor, a Champions League winner as a player and manager, is contracted to the French champions until 2025. She was capped 156 times by the France national team before retiring in 2013 to take up a coaching position within Lyon's Academy. Following the sacking of Jean-Luc Vasseur in April 2021, the 43-year-old was appointed as Lyonnais Feminin head coach. Chelsea players Catarina Macario and Kadeisha Buchanan were both coached by Bompastor at Lyon before their respective moves to west London. Stream the WSL and more with NOW Women's Super League table Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Sky Sports reporter Anton Toloui: Chelsea's move for Bompastor will come as a surprise for many reasons despite her playing and coaching career. To approach one of the few teams seen as genuine contenders for the Champions League is a bold one, especially as they could play each other in this year's final. Bompastor is seen as an exceptionally pragmatic coach, which may be one of the reasons Chelsea are interested, but it will be interesting to see what her vision for a post-Hayes future will be. Her strategic mind did win Lyon the Champions League in 2022, when her Lyon side outfought and out-thought all-conquering Barcelona. Bompastor is a winner both as a player and a coach and her team is experienced in filling trophy cabinets. She has also worked with big-money free agent signings Kadeisha Buchanan and Catarina Macario before, which will help her cause. But the approach for Bompastor shows how few top-level female candidates there are in the game. The fact there are so few women Chelsea see as qualified for the job is a sign of how much progress needs to be made. Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The rationale behind Chelsea making a beeline for Sonia Bompastor is twofold. The first, and should not be underestimated given Chelsea's recent history, is the fact she's a born winner. That's attractive to a team who have retained a monopoly over domestic silverware for the past five seasons. In her first full season in charge at Lyon, Bompastor led her side to a league and European double - beating Barcelona 3-1 in the Champions League final, scoring three times inside the opening 33 minutes. She holds an 85 per cent win percentage as manager. Her record as a player is similar, littered with triumphs and titles, as well as over 150 international caps. The list of achievements is vastly impressive. The second reason is less obvious but important to state. In Emma Hayes, Chelsea had a trailblazer. One of the game's chief champions who has been responsible for growth and change - a major player in improving the overall health of the sport. The fact she has done so from a female perspective is equally important. Hayes entered the game at a time when very few female voices were taken seriously - a gap in experienced female head coaches still exists to this day. Bompastor will be seen as one of the few coaches, currently managing at a top European club, who can directly relate. These are big boots to fill, and very few candidates with the credentials Chelsea would prioritise to fill them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  French football expert Julien Laurens speaking live from Paris on Sky Sports News: ""It would be a great choice. She's wonderful, she's had a great impact since she's taken over at Lyon. They play really good football and she's only a young coach. ""For me, she's got all the ingredients to become a top, top head coach. She is already. She speaks English too, so that wouldn't be a barrier. ""It's hard to follow in the steps of Emma Hayes, of course, it would be hard for anybody. But I think Bompastor would be keen for that challenge. She ticks all the boxes to become the next Chelsea manager.""

Confirmation that the Premier League had given its backing to the deal was contained within an update to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday evening. A further SEC update published on Wednesday afternoon confirmed that approval from the FA has been granted as completion edges closer, while the Barclays Women's Super League and Barclays Women's Championship board have also approved the acquisition. Within an amended tender offer statement published on Wednesday afternoon came confirmation that the national governing body's approval ""has already been obtained"". The green light from the FA is one of the last remaining steps but the deal cannot be completed until the tender offer for Class A shares is finalised.

235,Kylian Mbappe to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13072335/kylian-mbappe-to-leave-paris-saint-germain-this-summer,Kaveh Solhekol,Publish time not found,"Kylian Mbappe will leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer. Mbappe, out of contract in the summer, communicated his decision to Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the PSG president, on Tuesday. PSG expect Mbappe to join Real Madrid at the end of the season once the terms of his exit are finalised. The two parties still need to negotiate whether Mbappe will leave for a fee or sacrifice his own earnings. PSG have Mbappe's word that he will never leave on a free transfer. Real Madrid hold a long-term interest in the 25-year-old forward, who would have to take a pay cut to join the Spanish side, even though they are prepared to make him the highest-paid player in their history. PSG turned down a €220m (£188m) offer for Mbappe from Real Madrid in August 2021. The forward then chose to sign a new three-year deal with PSG that expires this summer. If Mbappe were to extend his deal by a further year, PSG would value him at €150m (£128m) in the upcoming transfer window. They accepted a €300m (£256m) from Saudi club Al Hilal last summer, which Mbappe turned down. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Mbappe's departure will be the next step in PSG's plan to move on from the individualistic Galacticos era, instead favouring a more youthful squad focused on the collective. This began when Neymar, Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos and Marco Verratti were allowed to move on. The departure of Mbappe, whose wages cost PSG €200m (£171m) per year, will free up funds for the club to replace their star player and it is understood there are already plans to make multiple signings this summer. Warren Zaire-Emery, 17, and Bradley Barcola, 21, have kick-started PSG's new project, with the French side boasting the youngest squad in the Champions League this season. Xavi Simons, 20, on loan at RB Leipzig, is another thought to be key to PSG's future. PSG are expected to offer renewals to Simons and Zaire-Emery, while Barcola signed from Lyon on a five-year deal in the summer. Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: ""As far as PSG are concerned, they knew this was coming. Mbappe had an option to extend his contract by another season. He told them last season he wasn't going to do that. ""He costs PSG an absolute fortune, in the region of £180m a year when you factor in his wages and bonuses. There's a sense of relief that this whole circus is going to be over and their future is going to move in a different direction. ""Everybody knows Real Madrid want to sign him. He's been in talks with Real for a long time because since January he's been able to talk to other clubs as he's out of contract this summer. ""Our information is, Real are prepared to make him the highest-paid player in history but there is no way a club even as big as Real can afford to pay him the kind of money he was earning at PSG. ""The talks have dragged on for so long because they have had to come to an agreement as he's going to take a wage cut. The first step in the process is he has told PSG he is leaving and they have acknowledged that."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Spanish football expert Alvaro Montero: ""Inside the club, everyone is positive, especially Florentino Perez and Jose Angel Sanchez. They are the ones who know what is going to happen. They believe in March or April that Mbappe will tell the club - not publicly - where he is going to play. ""Everybody inside the club believes he is going to play for Real Madrid but let's see what happens, especially in the next weeks. ""At Real Madrid, the player that earns the most is on €24m [£20m] per year. Real, it has been reported, could offer him €25m [£21m] after tax, so around €50m [£43m] before tax. ""Inside Real Madrid they believe that the amount of money Kylian has earned in the last two or three years is down in part to the famous £200m bid Real Madrid made to sign him before he signed a contract extension at PSG. ""The club believe that the money he has earned, in part, is thanks to Real Madrid's offer that was rejected by PSG.""

237,Watford 1-2 Leicester City: Patson Daka on target again as Championship leaders reach 75-point mark,https://www.skysports.com/football/watford-vs-leicester/report/485073,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Patson Daka set Leicester on course for a 2-1 win against Watford at Vicarage Road that maintained their 11-point lead at the top of the Sky Bet Championship. But Enzo Maresca's side were grateful for the cushion provided by Ricardo Pereira's second-half strike after a Harry Winks mistake gifted Emmanuel Dennis the chance to fire up hopes of a Hornets comeback. Daka converted a 10th-minute penalty for his third goal in three games since returning from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Zambia. And the Foxes stood firm to protect their lead after Winks' misplaced pass allowed Dennis to score his first goal since returning to Watford on loan from Nottingham Forest last month. Watford came into the game having failed to score in their three previous outings - and without a goal from open play in five games. But they were soon forced to rethink their forward plans when striker Vakoun Bayo pulled up just 75 seconds into the game. Maresca's side assumed control, displaying the confidence expected from a side with such a commanding lead at the top of the table. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp And it took them just 10 minutes to make the break after Dennis Praet outwitted Giorgi Chakvetadze to win a 10th-minute penalty. The Foxes midfielder broke into the box to collect a pass before cutting inside Chakvetadze who stuck out a trailing leg. Referee Oliver Langford immediately pointed to the spot and Daka beat goalkeeper Ben Hamer with a powerful low shot. Watford had made little impression on the game at that point and might have found themselves two down had Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall not shot over the bar after being set up by Daka. Valerien Ismael's side did manage to grow into the game as the half progressed and finally managed to test Leicester keeper Mads Hermansen when Wesley Hoedt shot from long range in the 33rd minute. That proved to be a rare moment of threat from the home side in the first half but they had shown signs of developing some momentum before the break. Leicester once again took the initiative at the start of the second half. And Maresca's men doubled their lead 10 minutes after the restart when Pereira slotted home after a sweeping counter-attack. The move was started by Hermansen and, when the ball was rolled out to Pereira, the Foxes skipper was allowed to run from deep before exchanging passes with Abdul Fatawu and placing his finish beyond Hamer. Watford almost responded immediately when Ken Sema's left-wing cross was deflected dangerously close to his own goal by Leicester defender Wout Faes. But it was an even more glaring error that gifted them the 63rd-minute strike that fired up hopes of a home comeback. Hermansen played the ball out to Winks, who completely miscued a first-time pass and succeeded only in finding Dennis, who was standing unmarked by the penalty spot and finished into an empty net. Watford pressed for an equaliser but were unable to prevent Leicester from seeing out a third successive league win. Watford's Valerien Ismael: ""I'm really proud of the players and pleased with the performance and mentality they showed. ""In this game, you saw we had bad luck. After one minute, Bayo was injured and we needed to change the plan. After that, a soft penalty. I've been many years in English football and that was a soft penalty. ""Even when 1-0 down, we were disciplined and we were aggressive. ""I said at half-time it was still 1-0, and we had to be patient. It would have been wrong to have lost our heads and pushed too much. ""We had two or three situations on the edge of the box when we should have taken one or both to get back into the game."" Leicester's Enzo Maresca: ""We got three points and yes we are happy because it has been a complete performance in terms of we play when we have to play. ""And we suffered together, after the goals we conceded we lost a bit of confidence but overall I'm happy. ""It has been a complete performance because when we needed to play, we played the way we want to play. It's part of the season we are trying to change some things. ""I can understand that the only thing that people can see is just get promoted. But for me get promoted is just at this moment. ""This was a club in transition last summer with lots of important players leaving. ""There are many more thing we have done.

238,Alejandro Grimaldo makes case as best full-back in Europe after free transfer to Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13066933/alejandro-grimaldo-makes-case-as-best-full-back-in-europe-after-free-transfer-to-xabi-alonsos-bayer-leverkusen,Nick Wright,Publish time not found,"He is the full-back with as many league goals as Victor Osimhen and more assists than Bruno Fernandes and Martin Odegaard combined. Alejandro Grimaldo has been one of the signings of the season. Best of all for Bayer Leverkusen? He cost them nothing. The 28-year-old, a free transfer from Benfica in the summer having run down his contract with the Portuguese champions, has played a crucial role in Leverkusen's ascent to the top of the Bundesliga, where Xabi Alonso's side sit unbeaten, dreaming of a first title. He boasts a phenomenal highlights reel. His tally of seven Bundesliga goals includes two sensational free-kicks, one of which came in September's 2-2 draw with Bayern Munich, the side they meet again in Saturday's crucial title showdown, live on Sky Sports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His outstanding ball-striking ability shines through in every one of his goals and in many of his nine assists too. His trademark is a low cross flashed towards the far post from the left-hand side of the box. But his set-piece deliveries are just as likely to result in a goal. His total of 16 goals involvements puts him well clear of any other full-back in Europe's major leagues, next on the list being Jeremie Frimpong, his Leverkusen counterpart. Factor in all players and he ranks in the top 20 in a list otherwise dominated by forwards. His impact at Leverkusen should come as little surprise. Alonso has helped by using a back three, allowing Grimaldo to play as a wing-back. But he racked up similar numbers across seven and a half seasons at Benfica playing primarily as a left-back in a four. Grimaldo helped Benfica win four Portuguese titles in that time. There were links with Premier League sides, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City among them. His former club Barcelona were said to be interested too. But their loss is proving Leverkusen's gain. Bundesliga fixtures Bundesliga table Stream the Bundesliga with NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Simon Rolfes, the club's sporting director, describes him as a ""simply incredible footballer, technically great and very intelligent"". He adds: ""Part of the reason why we dominate games to the extent we do at the moment is to do with him reading situations very quickly and coming forward to create overloads."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That combination of intelligence and technical guile comes up repeatedly in conversation with Andres Carrasco, the former U14 coach in Barcelona's La Masia academy who oversaw a crucial period in Grimaldo's career following his arrival from Valencia. ""At his previous club, he had been playing more centrally, as a midfielder,"" Carrasco explains to Sky Sports. ""But he was a player with really strong tactical understanding. We were looking for a left-back at that time, so we decided to move him."" Carrasco describes Grimaldo as ""the last piece of the puzzle"" in a formidable academy team that included one-time Sergio Busquets successor Sergi Samper, ex-Arsenal duo Hector Bellerin and Jon Toral, and winger Keita Balde, who would go on to play for Lazio, Monaco and Inter Milan. ""Normally, these types of midfield players don't like to move to full-back,"" he said. ""But his approach to the challenge was really good. He made it look easy because he was a smart and tactical player. He gave us a very dynamic left-hand side. He could find solutions easily. ""The defensive side was the biggest challenge."" Grimaldo was small in stature and stands at only 5ft 6in now. ""But he had the intensity for it. You didn't see him struggling because he was quick, he was energetic. The profile of a full-back was perfect for him."" And yet it is his history as a central midfielder, coupled with his technical schooling in Barcelona academy, which best explains the extent of what he is now offering Leverkusen. There are overlaps, cut-backs and crosses. But Grimaldo also comes inside to dictate play centrally. Only six players have made more final-third passes in the Bundesliga this season. None are full-backs. His character is another strength. ""His level of self-confidence was always very high,"" said Carrasco with a chuckle. ""He was excellent with his team-mates. Polite, attentive. But he also considered himself to be very good and that helped him."" It certainly helped when making the decision to leave Barcelona aged 20. Grimaldo had captained their B team in Spain's second tier. He was seen by many as a future first-teamer. But, seeing his pathway blocked by Jordi Alba, he was not willing to wait. ""Many players at that time at Barcelona had the same problem,"" said Carrasco. ""You might have to wait four or five years without making regular appearances, so if you want to play sooner and reach your maximum level, you have to make a decision."" Grimaldo blossomed at Benfica. But recognition in his homeland was slow to follow. It was only in November of last year, a month after his 28th birthday, having made his move from Portugal to Germany, that he finally made his debut for the national side. Why did the move to a truly top league not happen sooner? ""When you are enjoying it at your club, when you are having good performances week after week and playing in the Champions League every year, you probably don't want to move,"" said Carrasco. ""Obviously, the right offer and the right situation has to come. We know Barcelona were interested in him. Other clubs too. But Benfica is a massive club. A top club in Europe which consistently wins trophies and reaches the group stages of the Champions League."" Grimaldo was in no rush to leave, then. But the other side to it is that his suitors, particularly in the Premier League, had reservations about his physical attributes, chiefly his height. ""Of course, people talk a lot about the competition in the Premier League being much more physical, and Grimaldo, although he has good conditions, is not tall,"" said Carrasco. ""But he is very dynamic and the full-back position is probably the one that has evolved most in football. You need quality there, a smart player who can make good decisions under pressure, in different areas of the pitch. I'm not sure height is that important."" Leverkusen would agree given how Grimaldo has handled the defensive side of his role this season. He is above all an offensive outlet but, in a side that has only conceded 14 times in 20 games, there is little evidence that he is a weak link at the other end. According to Opta, he has only been dribbled past 13 times in his 20 appearances. His total of 32 tackles is second-highest among Leverkusen players. He does not contest many headers but he is tenacious in duels and disciplined when it comes to tracking back. It is just another way in which Leverkusen are feeling the benefits of his arrival. Grimaldo, overlooked at Barcelona and passed up by the Premier League's elite, is finally gaining the recognition he deserves.

239,Micky van de Ven: Tottenham defender smashes Premier League record for fastest speed,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/13067209/micky-van-de-ven-tottenham-defender-smashes-premier-league-record-for-fastest-speed,Adam Smith,Publish time not found,"Tottenham defender Micky van de Ven smashed the all-time Premier League record for top speed during the 3-2 win over Brentford last week - but who else ranks among the elite speedsters? Spurs fans are raving about the centre-back's ability to apply the afterburners and close runners down - protecting his team's high line. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 22-year-old reached a record-breaking speed of 37.38 km/h when he raced back to catch Lewis Keane-Potter, leapfrogging Manchester City speed demon Kyle Walker as the fastest player in Premier League history. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  No other player has smashed the 37 km/h threshold this term to date, with Luton's Chiedozie Ogbene and Wolves' Pedro Neto coming closest. In fact, Van de Ven joins Walker as the only player to smash past 37 km/h in top-flight history, with City's full-back clocking 37.31 km/h against Everton in May last year.

Every Premier League team has a player who has clocked more than 34 km/h, with the majority smashing past 35 km/h. Unsurprisingly, half of the club's fastest players are forwards but Ven de Ven is among four centre-backs on the list. For context, Usain Bolt clocked 44.72km/h between the 60- and 80-metre points during a 100m race in 2009, while his average speed across the entire distance was 37.58km. Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Micky van de Ven's speed after the Spurs defender was clocked as the fastest player in Premier League history since records began: ""We knew what we were getting from a physical perspective. His speed and ability to recover was elite. It's not just about running fast - football's more than that and you've got to use that in the right way. ""I've been really impressed with the way he has adapted to Premier League football, and being up against top strikers every week. His ability to use that speed in such an effective way in terms of his defensive work has been outstanding for a young man in his first year [of Premier League football]. ""Don't forget that before he came to us he only had one year in the Bundesliga, so there's so much more to come from him. I've been really pleased with the way he's gone up to this level and used what he has as his strengths."" Asked whether he fears Van de Ven will pick up another injury when he uses his speed, the Australian replied: ""No, you can't think of it that way. It's his game. ""He had the injury against Chelsea, there's always that possibility with high-performing athletes but he has a really good rehab programme and he hasn't missed a beat since he got back. ""Last week we pushed him to the maximum with such a short turnaround between Brentford and Everton, but he got through it okay and he's good to go.""

240,"Scottish Women's Premier League round-up: Rangers draw at Partick as Celtic, Hearts, Spartans and Glasgow City win",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/13069852/scottish-womens-premier-league-round-up-rangers-draw-at-partick-as-celtic-hearts-spartans-and-glasgow-city-win,Author not found,Publish time not found,"A round-up from the Scottish Women's Premier League as Rangers draw at Partick Thistle, and Celtic win at Hibernian, with Hearts, Spartans and Glasgow City recording big wins. Partick Thistle 0-0 Rangers Rangers were held to a goalless draw at Petershill Park as Partick Thistle claimed a point from the ScottishPower Women's Premier League encounter. Brian Graham's side dealt with the pressure from the league leaders well and ultimately came away with a well-earned draw. Rangers came out quickly in the opening minutes, with the closest call coming when Ave Easdon was forced to turn a Lizzie Arnot shot away from goal. The first chance for the hosts came when Linzi Taylor's cross fell to the feet of Demi Falconer. The captain shot from the edge of the box, but it narrowly flew over the crossbar. It was celebration for Thistle fans as they thought they had opened the scoring through Rosie Slater, but the referee blew for a foul in the build-up to keep the score level. Although the visitors tried to up the intensity in the second half, Thistle held their own and kept the Gers at bay. A game of few clear-cut chances ultimately ended in a point a piece, a result that the hosts will be extremely happy with as a statement of their further improvement this season. Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Live football on Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Hibernian 1-3 Celtic A brace for Tash Flint and a Caitlin Hayes header saw Celtic beat Hibernian in the capital to move within four points of Rangers, keeping them securely in the title race. Re-opening her Celtic account, Tash Flint found her first SWPL goal of the season as she made no mistake finishing from close range. Leading SWPL goalscorer Jorian Baucom equalised for Hibernian with 23 minutes on the clock. Baucom took advantage of Celtic playing out from the back and fired past Kelsey Daugherty to draw her side level. It didn't take too long for the visitors to take the lead again though, as a pinpoint Shen Mengyu cross found Caitlin Hayes at the back post, who was waiting to head home. Flint got herself a brace just before half-time. She got on the end of Hayes' header and fired beyond the goalkeeper to extend Celtic's lead. They went into the break with a 3-1 lead, and it ended that way as the Celts recorded an important win in the capital. Hearts 4-0 Aberdeen Four goals for Hearts helped them to close the gap on the sides above as they now sit just two points off fourth place. The Jambos found the breakthrough just before the half-hour mark as a corner found the head of Lizzie Waldie, who put it beyond the goalkeeper and into the bottom corner. Shortly after the goal, former Aberdeen player Jenna Penman doubled her side's lead as she sent a low drive into the back of the net. Georgia Timms threatened to make it three, but her attempts were kept out by the goalkeeper, allowing the Dons to go into the second half with only a two-goal deficit. Their chances of a comeback would be nullified when Danni Findlay made it three, and she would secure her brace with a curling effort right before the final whistle. Dundee United 0-6 Spartans A clinical performance from Spartans saw them come out on top in what could prove to be an important result in their bid to avoid relegation. The visitors took an early lead with only three minutes on the clock as a cross into the box found Hannah Jordan, who headed home the opener. Jordan found another in the second half as she was in the right position to smash home a rebound. The third came through Ronaigh Douglas, who struck from 25 yards out and into the top corner of the net. Becky Galbraith got a well-deserved goal next as she latched onto a pinpoint cross and headed beyond the goalkeeper. Robyn McCafferty got involved in the action as she looped a header over the United shot-stopper from a corner. Mya Bates rounded off a fantastic performance at Foundation Park as from the left wing, she sent a shot flying into the Dundee United net. It's a huge result for the Edinburgh side as Spartans move out of the relegation zone and into ninth in the table. Hamilton Accies 2-1 Motherwell It was derby day delight for Hamilton Accies as they pulled off a victory against Motherwell in the Lanarkshire derby. Goals from Josi Giard and Chloe Muir gave them a comfortable lead, and despite Laura Berry pulling one back for the visitors they fell to defeat. Giard opened the scoring in the derby as the forward chipped the ball over Emily Mutch. The hosts doubled their lead early in the second half as Muir fired from range and into the back of the net. The visitors pulled one back just a few minutes later, and they almost drew level, but Emma Thomson made a fantastic save to deny the equaliser. Montrose 1-5 Glasgow City Despite Montrose taking an early lead, it was five-star performance for Glasgow City, who ultimately cruised to victory. The hosts opened the scoring against the reigning league champions as Tammy Harkin headed in from close range. Just 15 minutes later, City found the equaliser as Mairead Fulton's cross was headed home by Kenzie Weir, and the visitors took the lead as Fiona Brown sent a cross into the box, that was headed into the net by Carlee Giammona for her first Glasgow City goal. Now on the front foot, the visitors were desperate for a third and they eventually found it. Brown cut inside and curled the ball into the top corner, giving her side a comfortable lead after the early scare. They weren't done either as Brown got a second, tapping home from Kinga Kozak's cross. Rounding off a good performance, Fulton struck from the edge of the box and found the top corner right before the final whistle.

241,Man Utd stadium plans: Will Sir Jim Ratcliffe build a new ground and what will it mean for Old Trafford?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13065910/man-utd-stadium-plans-will-sir-jim-ratcliffe-build-a-new-ground-and-what-will-it-mean-for-old-trafford,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Are Manchester United getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions... The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators. The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London. Billionaire Ratcliffe, who founded the INEOS group, is acquiring a 25 per cent stake of United for a fee of £1.2bn, which moved a step closer after a successful vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I was told that Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned up for one of his meetings and he had the feeling that for arguably the biggest football club in the world, the wow factor just wasn't there. I agree with that,"" said United We Stand Editor Andy Mitten to Sky Sports News. As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage. According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land. Latest Man Utd news Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Man Utd fixtures United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.  As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow. ""At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,"" he said. ""I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset."" Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. ""Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,"" he said late last year. ""If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world-class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan."" Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Oh, quite a lot. ""Old Trafford is falling down"" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season. The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland. ""The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,"" added Mitten. ""It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium. ""The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now. ""It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low. ""Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger."" Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. ""I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,"" he said late last year. ""I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing. ""It's important that you have pride in where you play and Old Trafford is an amazing stadium."" The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium. That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation. ""From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,"" he said. ""I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area. ""Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium. ""I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world."" Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019. One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans. The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010. The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn. Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020. As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work. United could lobby The Government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: ""Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future."" But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money. And United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?

242,Preston 2-1 Middlesbrough: Emil Riis scores winner for North End,https://www.skysports.com/football/preston-vs-mboro/report/485083,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Preston moved to within goal difference of the Sky Bet Championship play-offs after beating Middlesbrough 2-1 to claim a third consecutive win. Emil Riis scored the winner in the 60th minute after Finn Azaz's superb strike cancelled out Liam Millar's first-half opener. The victory secures a vital three points for Preston on a night when the club marked the 10th anniversary of the death of Sir Tom Finney with a rousing seventh-minute applause. The visitors started well and nearly took the lead in the 11th minute, when Sam Greenwood's deflected shot forced a good save out of Freddie Woodman after an interception from defender Greg Cunningham - an early substitute for the injured Andrew Hughes - fell into his path. The pressure kept on building thereafter and it was completely against the run of play that the Lilywhites, sporting a special edition kit in memory of Finney, went in front in the 23rd minute. Millar brought down Matt Clarke's attempted clearance with his right foot and fired a left-footed shot past Tom Glover from just outside the box. Leeds loanee Greenwood came close to equalising just beyond the half-hour mark, but his well-struck effort from distance went narrowly wide. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Shortly after the half-time interval, January signing Azaz's attempt deflected wide as Boro continued to push for the leveller. And it arrived through the same player in the 57th minute, opening his account for the club with a rocket of a shot into the top corner from 20 yards out. Boro soon found themselves behind again, though, with Riis tapping home on the hour-mark - his sixth goal in as many games for Preston against Boro - after Will Keane's shot fell very kindly to him. Michael Carrick's side did not let their heads drop and came close to equalising once more moments later, with captain Jonny Howson's attempt only being directed off target by a defensive header. Woodman had to be alert again in the 70th minute to keep out Marcus Forss' volley from close range. Luke Thomas worked space for a shot inside the final 10 minutes, but the Leicester loanee dragged his attempt past the post and that proved to be their last real opportunity. Preston are now in ninth place on 48 points - level with sixth-placed Coventry, seventh-placed Norwich and eighth-placed Hull - while Boro are seven points back. Preston's Ryan Lowe: ""It did give us extra motivation (the anniversary). ""We wanted to have a bit of a celebration because I think that's what it was, we wanted to show the family and our fans what we can do. ""It was important that we got a win on the back of that because there can be too much pressure on it. ""I've obviously got to be mindful of the fact that we have a game to play and try and win and it was a great occasion. ""We kept it simple, we knew what we were here to do, we respected the occasion and I think we've sent the Finney family and all of our fans home happy."" Middlesbrough's Michael Carrick: ""I think it's a tough result to take for sure. I think the results definitely aren't going our way. I thought tonight we definitely deserved an awful lot more from the game. ""But we're not getting it, so we need to accept that and we've got to do something about it. ""I can't fault the boys in terms of effort. Some of the quality of the play was really, really good, but we've definitely not got the balance between performance and results at the moment. ""They hadn't had a touch in our box and we were 1-0 down today. That was the only time they'd gone up there. ""It's happened probably two or three times over the last six weeks or so. With that, there's a lot of good things. ""There's a lot of good things in the game, but those moments are going against us and we have to accept that and we've got to do something about it.""

243,England Women: Leah Williamson earns first Lionesses recall since ACL injury return,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13070549/england-women-leah-williamson-earns-first-lionesses-recall-since-acl-injury-return,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Leah Williamson has been named in an England Women's squad for the first time since returning from a serious knee injury. England captain Williamson, who was forced to sit out last summer's Women's World Cup after suffering an ACL rupture, returned to action for the Gunners in late January after a nine-month lay-off, and is now back in Lionesses contention for the upcoming friendlies against Austria and Italy in February. It is the first time the Arsenal defender will feature in an England selection since the team lifted the Women's Finalissima trophy in April 2023. Jess Park, who last featured for the Lionesses in October, has also been included in the 23-player group. Millie Bright and Bethany England are out injured while there is no room for Nikita Parris despite a good run of form for Manchester United. This will be the final camp before England's qualification campaign for Euro 2025 begins in April - the draw for that competition takes place on March 5. Head coach Sarina Wiegman said: ""This camp is where the road to Euro 2025 in Switzerland begins. Playing against strong teams like Austria and Italy is just the preparation we need before we kick off our qualifying campaign in April. Free-to-watch WSL highlights Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports Stream the WSL and more with NOW ""I am really looking forward to getting back on the grass with the squad."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On Williamson's return, Wiegman said: ""It's really nice, especially for her. She's back. She's gaining minutes at Arsenal and doing well. It'll be really good to see her in camp. ""She's a very good player with great decision-making. She's been out for a number of months, so is still building. I've seen other players step up [in Williamson's absence]. Asked about Williamson's continuation as captain, the Dutchwoman added: ""It's a new moment. We'll start again, and have a conversation with the group."" Speaking about Nikita Parris' exclusion: ""The competition up front is really high. I've made some other decisions for this camp, but I hope she can keep some consistency because we're thinking about her again. ""I had a brief conversation with her yesterday, she understands. We're in a luxury position with our options in forward positions. She knows we're watching her very closely."" On the disappointment of missing out on Paris Olympics qualification: ""December was devastating. We played two incredible games - I saw rhythm in the team and performances were really good. We can't control what opponents do. We wanted to be on the other side and qualify, and we were disappointed. But we have the opportunity to play friendlies now to improve and develop. That's good too."" Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The fact that Sarina Wiegman is able to call on Leah Williamson again is a huge boost, particularly in light of Millie Bright's extended absence. Curiously, Wiegman stayed coy on Williamson's position as captain, presumably because she's been out of the fold for close to a year. A lot has happened since then. Williamson is yet to play a full 90 since her injury return and competitive minutes will need managing. Perhaps Wiegman will take this opportunity to test the waters - England haven't had the luxury of many international windows playing only friendly fixtures. The Dutchwoman was also quick to point out that others have stepped up admirably in the Arsenal defender's wake. I've particularly liked what I've seen in a leadership capacity from Georgia Stanway - she has captain energy. Mary Earps has also come to the fore. She led the side during a difficult December and is a commanding figure, reliable too. She'd be a popular appointment. Goalkeepers: Mary Earps (Man Utd), Khiara Keating (Man City), Hannah Hampton (Chelsea). Defenders: Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Jess Carter (Chelsea), Niamh Charles (Chelsea), Esme Morgan (Man City), Alex Greenwood (Man City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Leah Williamson (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Man Utd). Midfielders: Grace Clinton (Tottenham), Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Jess Park (Man City), Keira Walsh (Barcelona), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Man Utd). Forwards: Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Rachel Daly (Aston Villa), Lauren Hemp (Man City), Chloe Kelly (Man City), Lauren James (Chelsea), Beth Mead (Arsenal).

246,Stoke 1-0 QPR: Wouter Burger steers Potters to vital victory,https://www.skysports.com/football/stoke-vs-qpr/report/485084,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Stoke secured a first home win since October as they beat fellow strugglers QPR 1-0. A Wouter Burger strike on the cusp of half time was enough to end a run of four straight defeats in the Championship. The visiting Hoops, who could have moved out of the relegation zone with a victory, failed to extend their four-match unbeaten run. It could be an important first home win for Potters' boss Steven Schumacher, with his new side moving six points clear of the dreaded dotted line. Following two wins and two draws, a resurgent QPR started promisingly and nearly opened the scoring inside three minutes. The visitors carefully crafted a pocket of space and found Paul Smyth, but the winger's venomous strike was pawed away by Daniel Iversen. Stoke heeded their opponents' early warning sign and gradually grew into the fixture, with new forward Niall Ennis trying to instigate a response. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports The hosts had only scored two goals in their last eight home league games - with only one from open play - and their wastefulness in front of goal was on show again. Lewis Baker's outswinging corner was headed goalwards by Michael Rose, but the defender's effort was tipped over by Asmir Begovic. And the former Potters' stopper - who made 173 appearances in six years at the club - was in inspired form against his old employers. Fierce strikes from Burger and Ennis before the break had the same outcome, with Begovic twice coming to QPR's rescue. However, there was nothing the ex-Bosnian international could do just on the stroke of half time as Stoke took the lead with a goal that had been coming. A Baker corner again wreaked havoc with Luke McNally's flick-on finding the onrushing Burger, who converted a simple tap-in. It was a second league goal of the season for the Dutch youngster, whose only other second tier strike also came against the Rs in the reverse fixture in November. The home side's momentum was not swayed by the interval, with the Potters continuing to dictate the fixture. And they should have doubled their lead following a moment of pinball, but valiant QPR defending and another Begovic stop ensured the game remained within reach. Substitute Lyndon Gooch also came close to providing a Stoke second, yet his rifled strike whistled beyond the post. A late Hoops onslaught ensued with the influential Ilias Chair trying to unlock a resolute home defence. Ultimately, the hosts' slender lead was preserved as they avoided suffering a fifth successive league defeat for the first time since January 2005. Meanwhile, Marti Cifuentes' outfit remain entrenched in the relegation zone, four points from safety with 14 games still to play. Stoke's Steven Schumacher: ""We were all aware of how important the game was. It was an important win and a tough game against a team close to us in the league. ""The performance isn't one that we'll remember forever and the game wasn't a classic, but to get that win at home was so important. ""It's relentless and it's important that we back it up now and I hope that that result gives the players some confidence. ""It's not been easy to play here all season and it's been too long since we've won (at home), so hopefully that stigma has gone. ""We've played a lot better since I've been here than we did tonight but that doesn't matter; we got the win and the fans go home happy."" QPR's Marti Cifuentes: ""I'm disappointed. We had some good chances in the first half to take the lead but unfortunately, we went 1-0 down after a corner. ""They played a back-five and they showed respect to us and we couldn't get the flow we wanted, especially in the second half. ""It was not easy for us to break them down. Still, we tried to compete to the very last second but it was just one of those games. ""Today was a very important game in terms of the table but at the same time, whatever happened today, it wasn't going to be a season changer. ""We need to stay very calm; we're of course disappointed and angry, but we were unbeaten for four games and perhaps someone could think this would be easy.""

Saints had stormed into an early lead thanks to a Matt Smith goal but the Dark Blues fought back after the break with a controversial Luke McCowan penalty and what proved to be the winner in the closing stages from Jordan McGhee. The result leaves Dundee in sixth place, three points ahead of Hibernian, while St Johnstone remain 10th. The hosts had the first shot of the game in the fourth minute but Lyall Cameron's strike was deflected wide for a corner with the same player not far away with a curling effort shortly afterwards. However, it was Saints who made the early breakthrough in the ninth minute. Graham Carey found Smith just inside the Dundee box and the Wales international made no mistake with a clinical low strike that flew past home goalkeeper Trevor Carson and into the bottom corner of the net. The home side looked to hit straight back with midfielder Cameron trying his luck again but St Johnstone goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov dived to his right to snuff out the danger. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app The 'keeper then had a big scare when he attempted to clear but only succeeded in hitting Amadou Bakayoko, with the ball cannoning back into the side-netting. Dundee came close again when a shot inside the box from skipper Joe Shaughnessy took a nick and trundled just past Mitov's right-hand post. The hosts continued to look dangerous and came close to equalising again when an Aaron Donnelly header from an Owen Beck corner was cleared off his own line by Carey. Carson was called into action in the 33rd minute when a Shaughnessy header fell to Benjamin Kimpioka who unleashed a fierce drive with the 'keeper producing an outstanding acrobatic save to tip the ball over his crossbar. Saints struggled to create clear-cut chances after the break but they burst into life on the hour, with Adama Sidibeh producing a bicycle kick that Carson tipped over and then Andy Considine saw a header clatter off the home bar. However, Dundee finally equalised in the 65th minute. Referee David Munro was called to the pitchside monitor by the VAR to review an incident in the Saints box involving contact between Liam Gordon and Bakayoko, with the official awarding a penalty to the home side. McCowan stepped up and fired the spot-kick into the back of the net off the inside of a post. Dundee then completed their dramatic comeback in the 89th minute when Beck swung a cross into the Saints box with McGhee sending a superb glancing header past Mitov. The game ended on a sour note for the hosts when substitute Michael Mellon had to be stretchered off prompting 17 minutes of stoppage time. Dundee boss Tony Docherty said: ""My team were absolutely outstanding. ""Their level of performance for the majority of the season has been high but here they showed a real bravery. ""Every player deserves huge credit."" St Johnstone boss Craig Levein said: ""That's the third one of those (VAR decisions) that has gone against us. ""Maybe Dundee haven't had much luck recently but we certainly haven't, that's for sure. ""What really, really annoyed me was our response to it was abysmal. ""I apologise to our supporters for our second-half performance because it wasn't good enough."" Dundee's next Scottish Premiership game is at home to Ross County on February 17. Kick-off 3pm.

248,Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 Bayern Munich: Xabi Alonso's side go five points clear at the top of Bundesliga,https://www.skysports.com/football/leverkusen-vs-bay-munich/report/488511,Zinny Boswell,Publish time not found,"Harry Kane says Bayern Munich must turn their form around quickly after Bayer Leverkusen beat them 3-0 to go five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Alejandro Grimaldo, the star of the show, struck the decisive goal for Leverkusen, the only unbeaten team left in Europe, shortly after half-time to double their lead following Bayern loanee Josip Stanisic's first-half opener. Substitute Jeremie Frimpong added a third from range in stoppage-time with Manuel Neuer out of his goal. Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel played a back five to match Leverkusen, although the tweak backfired, with the champions always second best at the BayArena. Harry Kane, the club's record signing, had one of his quietest games since joining from Spurs. ""That's not for us to decide [if Leverkusen are title favourites], that's for everyone else to decide,"" said Kane. ""We have to improve. We have to get better. The games are coming thick and fast so we have to turn it around quickly."" ""I don't have an explanation for why we did not get Harry more involved in the game,"" added Bayern boss Tuchel. Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, meanwhile, passed their biggest test yet as the head coach, touted as the frontrunner to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, showed why there is so much hype around him, moving the club a step closer to their first league title. ""It was a very important win but it is just three points,"" said Alonso. ""We have to keep going. It is still February and we need to remain calm."" Live Bundesliga table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! An eight-minute delay to the kick-off, caused by projectiles thrown onto the pitch from the stands, seemed to add to the tension on both sides as we endured a scrappy start to the top-of-the-table clash. It quickly became apparent that Tuchel's tactical surprise hadn't worked as Leverkusen began to take charge of the game. Alonso's side looked destined to land the first blow through Amine Adli, expertly played in by Florian Wirtz, but he was denied at the last. Leverkusen made no mistake moments later when another chance arose. Bayern were punished for their slack defending by loanee Stanisic, perhaps the only person in the stadium to be muted in his celebration after he scored from Robert Andrich's low cross at the back post. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The hosts grew in confidence after the opener, with Nathan Tella, the former Burnley forward, seeing a first-time volley kept out by Neuer. Bayern's Dayot Upamecano had to produce a last-ditch tackle to remedy his error that allowed Adli through on goal. There was no let up for Bayern after the break as wing-back Grimaldo, a free transfer in the summer, tormented them down the left. There was pandemonium at the BayArena when he squeezed a strike past Neuer at the near post five minutes into the second half. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Grimaldo nearly scored direct from a corner as he cut across the ball with his left foot to bring it back towards goal. Neuer was scrambling as he struck the upright with what surely would have been a goal of the season contender. A Bayern comeback never felt likely, even when Tuchel returned to a back four, and the champions became desperate. Neuer's questionable decision to come up for a corner in stoppage-time was punished spectacularly by Frimpong, who hit a post moments before. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leroy Sane punched a camera in frustration at the final whistle, summing up the mood in Bavaria, where the pressure is growing on Tuchel. There will be questions for Kane too after he finished his most important game in a Bayern shirt with 20 touches and a single shot. Bayern Munich head coach Thomas Tuchel: ""We started well but then errors started creeping in. We were not able to carve out any chances, even later in the game when we had five or six attacking players. I don't have an explanation for why we did not get Harry more involved in the game."" Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane: ""We didn't play well with the ball. We pressed well but when we got it we seemed to give it back to them. That allowed them to build momentum. In the final third we weren't good in the one-vs-one battles or the duels. The final delivery wasn't there. A really disappointing day with the ball. ""We're five points behind but there's lots of games to go. This one hurts, we wanted a different outcome but we have to focus on the Champions League and make up as many points as we can in the league as quick as we can. ""That's not for us to decide [if Leverkusen are title favourites], that's for everyone else to decide. We have to improve. We have to get better. The games are coming thick and fast so we have to turn it around quickly."" Bayer Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso: ""Today it was a very disciplined performance from my team. It was not easy but we waited for our chances. Maybe we did not have the ball too much today but we wanted to be dominant even without the ball. ""It was a very important win but it is just three points. We have to keep going. It is still February and we need to remain calm."" Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp: ""You'd have to say [this is the perfect storm with Klopp leaving Liverpool at the end of the season]. ""It's a phenomenal rise because for somebody that was such a tremendous footballer. To then to go on and coach and make it look so easy - it's only his second season as a manager. It's been unbelievable the transformation. ""The differences [between him and Klopp] that people will look at will be the system, obviously they play three at the back. Liverpool, throughout all their successes, have played four at the back. ""Right now he is the outstanding candidate. It's a big risk for him, but it's a great opportunity, the opportunity of a lifetime. I don't see how you can turn it down. ""In his mind, every night, he will be going to bed thinking about taking care of winning the title in Germany. If he goes to Liverpool, he will be thinking 'this has to go right for me'. You are following one of the greats of football in Jurgen Klopp. It's not going to be easy. ""But he knows he is going to have the support of all the fans if he gets the job, everyone will be buying into what he wants to do. I don't see any candidates that are as good as him."" Bayer Leverkusen continue their Bundesliga title challenge next Saturday as they travel to Heidenheim for a 2.30pm kick-off on February 17. Bayern Munich now turn their attention to the Champions League with Thomas Tuchel's side heading to Italy on Wednesday to face Lazio in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie; kick-off 8pm.

249,AFCON Premier League transfer targets | Tournament player ratings,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/13962/13065304/afcon-premier-league-transfer-targets-tournament-player-ratings,Adam Smith,Publish time not found,"The AFCON semi-finals kick off live on Sky Sports on Wednesday with an abundance of talent on show - but which players could, and should, attract interest from Premier League clubs? Nigeria face South Africa in the 5pm kick-off, having won all three previous meetings at past Cup of Nations finals, the last in the 2019 quarter-final in Cairo. Hosts Ivory Coast are fancied to continue their remarkable revival at the tournament and ride a frenzied wave of home support as they seek a place in the final with victory over the DR Congo in the 8pm game. Ahead of the showdowns, Sky Sports has teamed up with leading sports intelligence agency Twenty First Group (TFG) to match the top prospects at the tournament with Premier League clubs, based on playing style and profiles. Nigeria: Ademola Lookman
South Africa: Teboho Mokoena
Congo DR: Arthur Masuaku
Ivory Coast: Franck Kessie First up, who's performed at the tournament so far? The TFG rankings place DR Congo left-back Arthur Masuaku - formerly of West Ham - top of the pack. Angola winger Gelson Dala sits in runner-up spot, ahead of numerous semi-finalists in the top 10, including Ademola Lookman (Nigeria), Teboho Mokoena (South Africa), Calvin Bassey (Nigeria), Aubrey Modiba (South Africa), Yoane Wissa (DR Congo) and Frank Onyeka (Nigeria). Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Download the Sky Sports App Live football on Sky Sports this week Factoring in all players aged 24 or under, the data wizards at TFG matched every prospect at the tournament with their most suitable Premier League club. Morocco and Genk teenage winger Bilal El Khannouss registers the highest suitability score and is matched with reigning Premier League champions Manchester City, with an estimated value of £22.1m. Next up is Ivory Coast stopper Yahia Fofana, who could give Crystal Palace 'keeper Sam Johnstone a run for his money, according to the data - registering a 96 per cent match with the Eagles and an estimated transfer fee of only £2.6m. Tunisia winger Mohamed Achouri is also paired perfectly with Roy Hodgson's side and would provide injury cover for their talismanic attackers Michael Olise and Ebere Eze. In terms of semi-finalists, Wolves are matched with Nigeria and Nice striker Teremas Moffi (£27.9m), while Ivory Coast and Roma centre-back Evan Ndicka (£42.4m) is matched with Spurs. The data predicts Rocky Bushiri (Congo and Hibernian, £700,000) and Karim Konate (Ivory Coast and RB Salzburg, £27.9m) would slot into Everton's ranks perfectly, while Samuel Chukwueze (Nigeria and AC Milan, £38.3m) would hit the ground running at Aston Villa. Use the interactive table below to find which prospects would suit Premier League clubs and their estimated transfer value. But which players provide the best value for money? Well, the scatter chart below plots AFCON U24 players' projected form rating over the next two years against their estimated annual salary and Ivory Coast star Ousmane Diomande emerges as the bargain buy - and he's matched with Pep Guardiola's juggernauts. The 20-year-old centre-back, who plies his trade with Sporting in Portugal, is estimated to cost just £1.7m in annual wages, with an estimated transfer fee of £30.5m, while he is also projected to develop more than any other player over the next two years (displayed by point size in the chart below). Morocco centre-back Chadi Riad also offers huge development potential over the next two years and would be expected to cost only £16.4m with an annual salary of just £1.1m. Domestically, the 20-year-old represents Real Betis, on loan from Barcelona. So, who's going to win the tournament? Well, with a combined value of £351m and an average career rating of 625 for squad players, Ivory Coast are certainly frontrunners. However, Emerse Fae's side have recorded a tournament-low 72-per-cent performance score so far. In contrast, South Africa's squad is estimated to be worth one-fifth of Ivory Coast's value at just £69m, but the underdogs have battled through to the penultimate round with a table-topping performance score of 89 per cent. Factoring in those insights, TFG predicts Ivory Coast are still on course for their first tournament win since 2015 with a 34 per cent probability, followed by Nigeria (25 per cent), DR Congo (22 per cent) and South Africa (19 per cent) - who had started the tournament with a meagre three per cent chance of going all the way. We have cobbled together the optimal starting XI for each semi-finalist, based on players' tournament rankings so far. We've also annotated any U24 starters who match with a Premier League club and highlighted each team's star player at the tournament. So, how should the teams look on Wednesday? Nigeria Well, here's a surprise: former Everton forward and Nigeria's standout player at the tournament Lookman starts up top, replacing Chelsea target Victor Osimhen - but the Napoli striker is doubtful to face South Africa with stomach pains. The data suggests Fulham ball-playing defender Calvin Bassey matches with Manchester City's style of play, while AC Milan winger Chukwueze could be perfect for Villa. South Africa Tournament underdogs South Africa have three Ms in their side to watch out for: central midfielder and star player Teboho Mokoena, who plays for his native Mamelodi Sundowns, while winger Thapelo Maseko (Mamelodi Sundowns) and striker Evidence Makgopa (Orlando Pirates) match with Luton. Ivory Coast There are few surprises with former AC Milan and Barcelona midfield maestro Franck Kessie ranking as Ivory Coast's star player but four team-mates are matched with Premier League clubs: defenders Wilfried Singo (Brighton, £25m), Ndicka (Tottenham, £42m) and Odilon Kossounou (Fulham, £24m), in addition to goalkeeper Fofana (Crystal Palace, £3m). DR Congo Masuaku is DR Congo's main man going into their showdown with South Africa on Wednesday evening, with Brentford forward Yoane Wissa not far behind the former West Ham full-back in the performance ratings.

250,Norwich City 2-1 Coventry City: Canaries hit back for victory over 10-player Sky Blues,https://www.skysports.com/football/norwich-vs-coventry/report/485055,Author not found,Publish time not found,"A late strike from Borja Sainz saw Norwich come from behind to beat Coventry 2-1 in an entertaining Championship clash at Carrow Road. The Spanish winger produced a neat finish in the 84th minute to condemn the 10-man Sky Blues to their first defeat in 13 matches. Mark Robins' side had gone ahead early in the second half through Callum O'Hare's well-taken goal, only to be pegged back 12 minutes later through Josh Sargent's close-range finish. The game turned again with 19 minutes remaining when Liam Kitching was sent off for bringing down Sargent as he burst into the box, with Norwich going on to make their extra man tell to move level with their opponents in the play-off race. Norwich had marginally the better of a competitive first half which featured plenty of neat passing football but with little end product. Coventry goalkeeper Bradley Collins did well to push away an early shot from Christian Fassnacht that was heading for the bottom corner before Sargent steered the ball wide from a good position under pressure from a visiting defender. The sides tended to cancel each other out as the half progressed, with both keepers largely untested. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports But Coventry also posed a threat, with the lively Haji Wright bringing out a decent save from Angus Gunn at the near post after trying his luck from a tight angle. The Sky Blues made their first opportunity of the second period count, however, with O'Hare's fine individual goal making it 1-0 in the 48th minute. Norwich put themselves under pressure with a poor throw and Victor Torp slipped the ball through to O'Hare, who skipped past a couple of defenders before slipping the ball past Gunn. The Norwich keeper then did well to foil a fast-breaking Wright as the Sky Blues sought to press home their advantage but the hosts hit back on the hour mark to level the scores. Recently-introduced substitute Ashley Barnes saw his shot from a Gabriel Sara cross blocked but the ball fell nicely for Sargent to volley home his sixth goal of an injury-hit campaign. Norwich were now on the front foot and received a further boost on 71 minutes when Kitching was shown a straight red card for bringing down Sargent on the edge of the box when he was the final defender. Sara clipped the crossbar from the ensuing free-kick. Coventry substitute Kasey Palmer was then denied by an excellent reaction save from Gunn but Norwich kept pressing and got their noses in front for the first time on 84 minutes. The goal came after a break down the left, with Sainz exchanging passes with Barnes on the edge of the box before curling a delightful shot past Collins and into the far corner of the net. Norwich's David Wagner: ""I thought it was a fantastic afternoon, both with the result and the performance which I also thought was top class, especially in the first half. ""We didn't get the goal we deserved and then went behind early in the second half with a goal that was avoidable from our point of view. ""But the players reacted well and to come back from 1-0 down to win 2-1 against a top side like Coventry is a fantastic achievement. ""It was good the players from the bench made an impact and that's how it should be. We have a competitive group so when we lose our top scorer (Jon Rowe who missed the game with a hand injury) we can cope. ""It's another good step in the right direction and we now look forward to the next challenge at QPR next Saturday."" Coventry's Mark Robins: ""I can't help feeling hard done by after that - we played some decent football out there and to come away with nothing was bitterly disappointing. ""There's no doubt the red card changed the game - at that point I felt we had a good chance to go and win it. ""We were still in it with 10 men but Norwich have a lot of quality and they punished us in the end. ""In the end I think it comes down to taking chances - we scored a good goal and then Haji Wright has had an excellent chance to make it 2-0 and I think it would have been game over then, red card or not. ""The keeper has made a save but he shouldn't have had that chance. Kasey (Palmer) has also had a great chance at 1-1 but the keeper has saved again. ""It is a disappointing result and we also lose Liam Kitching for a couple of games now as it was his second sending off while Ben Sheaf is out for six-to-eight weeks. ""But we just have to take this on the chin - the games are coming thick and fast now and there are plenty of other good players in the building.""

Ryan Ferguson, 24, of Liverpool, pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment, failing to comply with a football banning order and resisting a police constable at Rovers' League One clash with Fleetwood in April last year. Douglas Mackay, the Crown Prosecution Service Sports National lead prosecutor, said: ""Ferguson's actions were vile and something that none of us should ever experience at a football match - whether that be fans, staff, police or indeed the players themselves. ""The sentence that has been passed today should serve as a wake-up call to any fans who think it might be acceptable to break the law during matches."" The Black Footballers Partnership, the organisation set up to be a strategic voice and support for Black footballers, said the sentence shows the game needs to do better to support Black players. ""Black excellence on the pitch has driven up participation numbers and lessened the amount of overtly racist chanting on the terraces, so that events like those discussed today stand out more,"" said Delroy Corinaldi, the BFP executive director. ""However, while black excellence on the pitch pushes the overt racists to the margins, the ignorance it personifies can only be excised when black footballers become visible as black managers, coaches, board members and owners. ""It ends when the clubs and their representative bodies properly tackle the institutional barriers to black success off the pitch."" A PFA spokesperson added: ""It's absolutely vital that members see that there will be serious consequences for those who racially abuse players. ""The start of this process is often a member making the decision to tell the officials or to stop a game so that they can report an incident. That takes bravery. ""If players are the ones who are asked to start that process, they have to have confidence that the authorities with the power to do so are going to then finish it."""
252,Wolves 0-2 Brentford: Ivan Toney scores third in four games as Bees relieve pressure with rare win,https://www.skysports.com/football/wolves-vs-brentford/report/482830,Ron Walker,Publish time not found,"Thomas Frank urged Gareth Southgate to recall Ivan Toney for England after the Brentford striker came off his sick bed to seal the points in a shock 2-0 win at Wolves. The Bees came to the Black Country without a single point on the road since late October, but struck a deserved opener 10 minutes before half-time when Christian Norgaard nodded Sergio Reguilon's corner beyond a stranded Jose Sa. Wolves twice hit the post through Pedro Neto and thought they had found an equaliser when Craig Dawson glanced a cross home before VAR ruled the defender offside. The hosts dominated the second period but struggled to create further opportunities without the influential Matheus Cunha, who worryingly headed straight down the tunnel after being substituted following a heavy fall before half-time. In fact, Brentford showed little sign of a team who had dropped a league-high 26 points from winning positions, and instead displayed a clinical edge as Toney coolly volleyed a second home from their only chance of the second half. That was enough to end a run of seven defeats from eight for the visitors, who moved six points above the relegation zone with a vital three points. ""I know what Ivan can bring and I think it's something different England don't have,"" said Frank afterwards of his forward, who earned his one England cap against Ukraine at Wembley last March. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! ""He played a fine game, not a top game but the strikers need to score goals. He scored again when he had to and he played with illness, he was ill Thursday, Friday and today. ""It shows everything about his mentality. He is unique.

What Ivan is very good at is being in the moment, right now, here, ready. That's what he is focusing on. ""It would be great if he keeps going. He has all the qualities for it. We know we will create chances for him and big chances."" Wolves: Sa (6), Semedo (6), Kilman (6), Dawson (5), Toti (6), Ait-Nouri (7), Gomes (6), Lemina (5), Sarabia (6), Cunha (6), Neto (7).

Subs used: Yarmolyuk (6), Lewis-Potter (7), Ajer, Baptiste (n/a).


Player of the match: Christian Norgaard. Thomas Frank had insisted his side had deserved more than their dismal recent run of form and sent his side out to prove it from the off at Molineux, with the high-pressing and quick tempo of old finally back in full flow from the first whistle. Wolves never got to grips with their first-half intensity and Neal Maupay twice could have put them ahead in the early stages, first denied on the half-volley by Sa before his glancing header from the resulting corner was comfortably held. Norgaard made sure his contribution was more telling when he got to another corner with half-time approaching, holding off Dawson to nod into an unguarded net at the near post after Sa failed to anticipate his late run. It was an unusually timid showing from Gary O'Neil's side, not aided by Cunha's withdrawal, and it was no surprise they returned with more fight and intent, as well as a change in shape to accompany Nathan Fraser's introduction. Neto had pulled a strong stop out of Mark Flekken with Wolves' best effort before the break and he went closer soon after it, smacking the base of the post following a deep cross, before the hosts thought their improvement had been rewarded through Dawson's header. He glanced Neto's inviting delivery past a motionless Flekken only to see his moment of redemption cut short, when a VAR review noticed him inches ahead of the last man and just offside. Brentford heeded the warning and dug in for the rest of the second period, resolutely defending their 18-yard box while struggling to make anything stick on the break. They made their one opportunity of the half count as Toney showed the Bees what they had been missing, and how Cunha's absence had robbed Wolves, by anticipating Vitaly Janelt's floated cross perfectly and holding off his man to beat Sa from 12 yards. Wolves never threatened from then on, as the hosts continued to dominate without a cutting edge, and a muted Molineux fast began to empty. Both Wolves and Brentford are back in Premier League action next Saturday. Wolves travel to Tottenham on February 17; kick-off 3pm.

The strike early in the second half from Gnonto, just the 20-year-old's second league goal of the season, proved decisive at Ashton Gate, and took Leeds into the automatic-promotion places for the first time this season.

The first came via a mistake from George Tanner, which allowed Crysencio Summerville to race in on goal, before his effort to dink it over Max O'Leary was kept out by the Bristol City goalkeeper. O'Leary was also on hand to deny Georginio Rutter from close range, who couldn't beat him from six yards after the ball had ricocheted into his path from Patrick Bamford's cross. Just after the break, however, they found their way through. Junior Firpo's ball found Gnonto on the edge of the box, who made space and then fired one in. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Liam Manning responded with a double change for Bristol City, throwing on Taylor Gardner-Hickman and Anis Mehmeti - and the latter nearly levelled things up against the run of play a few minutes later as he was found through on goal by Tommy Conway, but saw his low attempt kept out well by Ilian Meslier. And that would be that for Bristol City, as Leeds saw out the win at Ashton Gate that keeps them well in the race for the Premier League. Bristol City's Liam Manning: ""You have to give Leeds credit for their level of performance. They're the best side we've played so far. You want to then find out what level you're capable of, and the disappointing thing is we're capable of a much higher level.

James Bolton was sent off for the home side late on after Mandron had put them in front but the visitors could not capitalise on the man advantage and conceded a second goal to Olusanya in injury-time. The victory extended fifth-placed Saints' advantage over Dundee to nine points albeit having played two games more. Manager Stephen Robinson went with the same starting line-up that thrashed Hibernian 3-0 at the weekend, with returning Australia international Keanu Baccus named among their substitutes. Dundee, in turn, made just one change from their defeat to Hearts, with former Saints striker Curtis Main replacing Amadou Bakayoko in attack. Kick-off was delayed by 30 minutes after the Dundee team bus was caught in traffic on their way to the stadium from their hotel. It was the home side who had the first real chance, with Mandron's turn and shot well off target. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Elvis Bwomono then unleashed a long-range effort that similarly flew over the crossbar. Dundee responded with a Jordan McGhee header that was also off target before Trevor Carson was the first goalkeeper called into action to save Mandron's low effort at the other end. Alex Gogic then came close to opening the scoring with a flicked header from Greg Kiltie's corner but it drifted just wide of the far post. James Scott launched a shot that nearly sailed over the stand as St Mirren turned up the pressure without giving the Dundee defence too much to worry about. The visitors almost forged in front on a counter-attack following a St Mirren corner. Luke McCowan sent Owen Beck running clear from just outside the Dundee box but he was tracked all the way by Hyeok-kyu Kwon, on loan from Celtic, who did well to block the Liverpool loanee's shot. Beck then pulled his second effort wide. Saints had the first chance of the second half but Bolton's header from Caolan Boyd-Munce's corner lacked the power to beat Carson. Gogic then headed wide from Kiltie's free-kick before Baccus' drive from the edge of the penalty box touched the top of the crossbar before going over. St Mirren's pressure finally told after 73 minutes when they went ahead. Mandron's strike looked to be covered by Carson but the Northern Irishman could only push his shot into the net. Mandron then passed up a gilt-edged chance to double the home side's lead before substitute Lewis Jamieson saw his low driven shot well saved by Carson and Kiltie blazed an effort wide at the far post. St Mirren played out the last five minutes with 10 men after Bolton was sent off for a heavy tackle on Owen Dodgson before Olusanya sprang the Dundee offside trap to score their second goal in stoppage time. St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: ""I thought it was very important in the last two games to get maximum points which we've done. ""We created a lot more chances and it probably should have been more comfortable than it was. ""Dundee were stubborn but we defended well, too. We controlled the game and made lots of good chances. Trevor Carson made two great saves, one in the first half and one in the second. ""It was important to follow up Saturday's result with another good one. So we're delighted to be able to do that. ""Dundee are a good side. If you're not going to finish teams off you run that risk. We knew we'd have a chance to counter-attack with Toyosi coming off the bench. It's our third win in four games and fifth in 10. There's a real belief in the squad."" Dundee manager Tony Docherty: ""There was a decision in the 87th minute that should have gone our way, based on previous games. We're aggrieved at that. ""It's a handball that's identical to the one Lee Ashcroft was punished for on Saturday. Yes, I agree the player's hands weren't in an unnatural position. ""But it stops the ball's path to goal. I don't understand why that one against Hearts was a penalty, and that one wasn't."" St Mirren's attention turns to the Scottish Cup with a fifth-round tie against holders Celtic on Sunday.

The new stadium will have a capacity for over 12,500 fans, include a safe-standing area in the home end and has been designed to also hold music concerts and other major entertainment events. Currently Dundee play at Dens Park - which has been the club's home since 1899 - but that could soon end if the project to build a new stadium and campus at Camperdown Park goes ahead. Both the Scottish FA and Scottish Professional Football League have welcomed the move following the submission of planning permission to the city council. Ian Maxwell, Scottish FA chief executive, said: ""Dens Park has been an iconic Scottish football stadium for more than 100 years and while fans of all generations will cherish their favourite memories inside the stadium, we understand the club's wish to future-proof their home and improve the matchday experience for supporters for the next 100 years. ""The Scottish FA is supportive of plans that will improve club infrastructure, the supporter experience and the image of the national game."" Neil Doncaster, SPFL chief executive, added: ""Any club that seeks to invest in improving infrastructure to this scale deserves enormous credit.

257,Fulham 3-1 Bournemouth: Rodrigo Muniz nets twice for Cottagers,https://www.skysports.com/football/fulham-vs-bmouth/report/482823,Richard Morgan,Publish time not found,"Two goals from Brazil striker Rodrigo Muniz saw Fulham beat Bournemouth 3-1 in the battle of two midtable sides at Craven Cottage. Fulham made a dream start when Bobby Decordova-Reid took advantage of a slip in the box from Lewis Cook to fire his side ahead after just five minutes, before Muniz, whose performance was his best ever for the club according to boss Marco Silva, got in on the action. The forward's first goal was an opportunistic effort, stealing in ahead of a dawdling Neto to double the hosts' lead nine minutes before half-time. Despite Bournemouth defender Marcos Senesi cutting that advantage in half with a neatly taken strike five minutes into the second period, it was that man Muniz who restored the Cottagers' two-goal cushion just minutes later as he put away Willian's inviting cross to the far post. Dominic Solanke had chances to bring his team back into the game, but for once the striker's radar was off and as a result, Silva's team moved above their opponents into 12th in the Premier League standings after two recent draws, while the Cherries slip to 13th as their win-less top-flight run continues. Fulham:  Leno (6), Castagne (6), Diop (7), Ream (7), Robinson (8), Palhinha (7), Cairney (7), De Cordova-Reid (7), Pereira (6), Willian (8),
Muniz (9)


Subs:  Reed (6), Wilson (6), Broja (6), Traore (6), Ballo-Toure (6)


Bournemouth:  Neto (6), Smith (6), Zabarnyi (6), Senesi (6), Kelly (6), Cook (6), Christie (6), Tavernier (7), Scott (6), Sinisterra (7), 
Solanke (6)


Subs:  Kerkez, Faivre, Ouattara, Semenyo, Unal


Man of the match:  Rodrigo Muniz With both teams looking to get back to winning ways after recent draws, it was the hosts who made the better start to proceedings in west London, striking early, albeit with a helping hand from Bournemouth. There appeared little danger to the visitors when Muniz centered, only for Cook to stumble, although Decordova-Reid still had a lot of work to do to find the far corner of the net with an accurate low drive. How the teams lined up Match stats Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW It was another defensive slip that saw the Cottagers double their lead on 36 minutes when again, there appeared little threat as Willian's ball floated to the far post, with Reid heading the centre goalwards. The home side made two alterations to the team that were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley last time out, with Tom Cairney and Issa Diop starting in place of the benched Tosin Adarabioyo and Harrison Reed.


On-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja, meanwhile, had to settle for a place on the sub's bench.


The visitors also made two changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Sunday as both Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier given the nod, with Justin Kluivert and Antoine Semenyo having to settle for a place on the bench.


However, forward Enes Unal, who joined the Cherries in January, was also a sub. Neto looked the favourite to gather, only for the ever-alert Muniz to steal in to poke home his second league goal in a week as Fulham were cruising at the break. However, Bournemouth responded at the start of the second half as Senesi showed the skills of a forward to turn and swivel in a tight space in the six-yard box after a corner to the far post was headed back his way by Solanke. But if Cherries boss Andoni Iraola thought that was the start of the comeback, he was mistaken as the hosts hit back immediately with a neat move after the visitors lost possession to Tom Cairney. The Fulham skipper powered forward before finding the evergreen Willian and the Brazil forward's inviting, lofted centre was tucked away by Muniz at the far post as the home side moved above their opponents in the standings. Fulham boss Marco Silva: ""I'm really pleased for him [Muniz] and he really deserves it. ""When you have the chance, you have to step in and pop up and show your quality and it was the moment for Rodrigo to do it. ""The way he linked our game and played behind the pressure of the midfielders was really good. ""Not just him [Armando Broja], but everyone [has to be patient]. ""He's a player who is here to help us and I believe he will help us. It's competition between strikers and I will decide what is best for us in each game. ""We believe Armando will help us in the next few months because he is a player with a profile which I think will help."" Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola:""I think we conceded too much at the beginning of the game, and that's the main reason we didn't get anything from today. ""I will say, after 2-0 I think the team did a lot of very good things. We arrived a lot [in their box], we created a lot of chances. ""We put them under pressure, but we conceded too much at the beginning. ""The first goal it happens - a player that slips in a dangerous position. ""But the second one we had the numbers to deal with the cross much better. ""I think we were late to react to the second balls, especially second goal. ""You can see that there are a couple of situations where they just arrive a little bit earlier, especially in this pitch where there's not a lot of space in the middle. ""Both teams want to get on the ball, we have to be quicker to react to these things. ""The first goal is difficult to blame someone because it's a slip, it's so easy. ""But we have to start with more intensity."" Analysis by Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: It is fair to say Rodrigo Muniz has taken his time to settle at Fulham following his arrival at the club from Flamengo in August 2021, but it looks the striker is now ready to take his chance in west London. Having helped the Cottagers gain promotion back to the Premier League in his debut campaign with Marco Silva's side, Muniz was then sent out on loan to Middlesbrough last season. However, the Brazilian struggled in the north east, scoring just twice, and returned to the capital looking to re-establish himself as Fulham's main marksman following Aleksandar Mitrovic's departure to Al Hilal in August. But with first-choice forward Raul Jimenez injured against Everton, Silva turned to Muniz rather than on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broj - and the 22-year-old has not let his manager down, scoring his first Premier League goal for the club in last weekend's 2-2 draw at Burnley, before grabbing two more in Saturday's 3-1 home win over Bournemouth. And after the game, Silva highlighted Muniz's display, saying: ""This afternoon was probably his best performance in a Fulham shirt and he deserves it because he's worked really hard. ""He had a good preseason followed by a bad injury, but now he's coming back and he's fighting for what he wants and he's showing the desire to play as the Fulham striker."" All of which means the Portuguese will have a tricky choice to make in attack when Jimenez returns from injury, with the exciting Broja also on the bench against the Cherries. But after this eye-catching performance up front, it would be a brave man not to continue with Muniz when Aston Villa visit the Cottage next Saturday. Both Fulham and Bournemouth are back in Premier League action next Saturday with both matches kicking off at 3pm. Fulham host Aston Villa on February 17, while Bournemouth will travel to Newcastle and face former Cherries manager Eddie Howe.

He's a young kid, he's 21 and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. If there was one thing you could bottle up in football, you ask anyone, it's confidence. He's got confidence now and football is all about confidence. He holds the ball up well and lays it off well to the wingers. You start to get into the game a lot more and the confidence rises. Those chances keep coming and you start to take them. In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it. If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Harry Maguire was named player of the match for United against Villa. It was a good performance and I'm pleased for him. He's a worker and he puts his body on the line. If I was playing, he's the type of player you'd want in your team. However, there's a thin line between centre-backs doing well and not doing well. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aston Villa created so many chances and if they take some of them we are having a different conversation. Villa could have scored four and then we are talking about a poor day for that United back four. That's how quickly things can change in football. However it was Maguire and United's day. He's a threat in both boxes and what I like is that when he is up for a corner he tries to score and have an effect on the game. A lot of defenders just go up and go through the motions. They are only up because the manager told them to go up. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Man Utd are on a good run and have a good run of fixtures coming up, but they will have to keep winning games. Tottenham also have good fixtures coming up as this race for the Champions League starts to get interesting. But like with Hojlund, Man Utd are now full of confidence. Hojlund is scoring goals now, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are threats on the wing. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I still think their game-management is poor. There are still moments when they are giving the ball away so cheaply and making the wrong decisions, and it did catch up with them as Villa piled on some continuous pressure. When they can learn that side of the game United will be a much better team. They are always going to score goals with Hojlund, Rashford and Garnacho. They just need to keep things tight at the back because for me, it will be very rare if they come off pitches between now and the end of the season without goals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aston Villa played really well against Man Utd, but they still came out on the losing side. That is a little bit of worry. Villa created so many chances. If they create that many in another game they probably get all three points. Villa will be disappointed. You can take it when you don't play well and lose, it's just one of those things, but there is nothing worse than playing well and losing football matches. Their last five fixtures haven't been the easiest. Everton is a hard place to go, on their day Newcastle can beat anyone, Chelsea were going to click one day and then there's United. It's not like Villa have played four teams at the bottom. They have played decent teams and just haven't got the results. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The name of the game now for Villa is to get back on the horse, win their next game and go again. They've got to get back to winning ways quickly. When you are winning week in, week out the players and the fans would have been turning up expecting to win with their 13th, 14th and so on victory on the trot at home. But all of a sudden, Newcastle did a job on them. Then Chelsea wiped the floor with them and now United have won. It did get nervy at the end of the game for Villa. They have got to get back to winning ways quickly. They are where they are in this league because of their home record and they've got to get winning again at Villa Park.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  We've still got a little bit to go before we get to the serious business of the run-in. That all starts with eight games to go in my opinion. Then we get to back to the importance of which team plays first on the weekend. It plays a huge part, in my opinion. Arsenal had to win at West Ham just to stay where they are. It takes its toll. We saw it a few years ago now with Spurs when they were chasing Leicester. They kept playing second. Talk to Tiger Woods about matchplay. He wants to put his ball on the green first to build the pressure on his opponent. It makes a huge difference. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Defending-wise from West Ham, if that happened in Under-10s football you'd be going, 'seriously?!' Not getting tight to the Arsenal players, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor.

There is ways of losing football matches, that is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today.

Let us leave it to Daniels to describe the moment. ""It was a throw-in from our right-hand side and we worked the ball across the pitch through midfield. It comes out to me on the left centre-half and I just ran in, passed the ball and continued my run. Nice link-up play between myself, Jack Earing and Liam Gordon."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And then the strike. What a strike. ""Back of the net, top corner,"" he tells Sky Sports. ""It is a lot harder than it looks."" The reaction of his team-mates told a tale. ""They expected me to score but not that type of goal. They were actually giving me stick because I have had quite a few chances throughout the season and I have not put it in the net. And when I scored, everyone was, like, 'Your celebration needs to be better.'"" Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Download the Sky Sports app Stream Sky Sports on NOW Transfer Centre LIVE! Perhaps he should have gone with the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration that he had cranked out after scoring his first goal for his country, Montserrat, in November. I should have pulled that one back out,"" he laughs. ""That would have been suitable for the goal, actually."" This is a hot streak then? ""I wish it was. It is two in 40 games!"" In conversation at the club's training ground, Daniels makes for amiable company, pulling up the chairs for us to discuss his goal and the wider context of Walsall's season. The goals may be rare but as captain there is a role to play beyond the very occasional screamer. He is having a good season, personally. ""Just my normal, solid, consistent self, I would say."" But as well as the familiar duties that come with defending, the 30-year-old Daniels also tops the list for most accurate long passes by a defender in League Two. ""I would definitely say it is one of my strong attributes. I think it is why the gaffer plays me on the left side because he knows I can come inside and find the diagonal pass or a third-man runner over the back. I am also very comfortable on my left side."" The best football of a career in which he won the League One title with Wigan in 2016? Perhaps it is his most consistent. He has played more for Walsall than any other club. ""I have improved a lot as a player and as a man. I saw it as an opportunity to start again. ""I feel like Walsall has birthed me anew."" He has certainly embraced the captaincy. ""It is also one of my roles here to be somewhat of a mentor. Lead from the front with my performances, first and foremost, and then try to help the boys with certain conversations. ""Whether it is keeping them grounded when they are in a rich vein of form or picking them up when they are not doing so well. That is something I have had from more senior lads during my career and it is something I want to give now to the lads in the group."" Protecting those team-mates is part of it. Earlier this season, a video clip went viral - attracting over a million views - when Daniels briefly motioned towards an Alfreton fan who was giving the players stick as they walked past. He smiles at the recollection. ""I just felt like me and the team were getting a lot of criticism that day. My reaction was just to let that person know we are still human and have emotions as well. I did not get in any trouble. In the end, it just turned out to be a little bit of laughing."" What next? Walsall began 2024 with a 6-1 battering of Grimsby that put them right in play-off contention, a fifth win in six games. But a run of draws has seen them slump to 16th. Such is life in League Two that they are only eight points off the play-offs even now. ""It would be a lie if I said we are happy where we are,"" says Daniels. ""But, overall, I still feel we are in a good position. We have a young squad so there are going to be moments of inconsistency. But we have got a settled team. Our hope is to pick up the performances and at the end of the season the cards will lie where they lie. ""We are not being brash by saying we are going to achieve something but we have aspirations to achieve something. If we can capitalise on our opportunities, we can get into the play-offs, which is where we want to be, and get out of this division."" And how about another League Two goal of the month award for February? There are still four games left in which to win it. But while Daniels is an optimist when it comes to Walsall's season, he is not so sure about his own transformation into a striker supreme. ""I don't think I will be able to retain it,"" he laughs."
260,PSG 2-0 Real Sociedad: Kylian Mbappe on target in first-leg last-16 Champions League win,https://www.skysports.com/football/psg-vs-sociedad/report/501466,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Kylian Mbappe grabbed the first goal and Bradley Barcola added the second as Paris Saint-Germain beat Real Sociedad 2-0 in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16. Sociedad dominated the game for long spells despite missing key players through injury, until Mbappe's goal in the 58th minute. The breakthrough came when Marquinhos headed on Ousmane Dembele's corner from the right and Mbappe was unmarked at the back post to volley in. A few minutes later, his strike from the edge of the penalty area was tipped on to the crossbar by goalkeeper Alex Remiro. But Remiro was beaten again in the 70th minute when the speedy Barcola broke down the left, skipped past right-back Hamari Traore with ease and poked the ball in - prompting coach Luis Enrique to jump off the bench to celebrate. There was relief, too, that Mbappe lasted the whole game after his sore left ankle kept him on the bench for Saturday's Ligue 1 game, but he showed no ill effects when he latched on to Dembele's pass and forced a save in the sixth minute. After that chance, however, PSG's intensity dropped right off. Even though Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil was without goalscoring midfielder Mikel Oyarzabal and left-back Kieran Tierney, the intensity and organisation of Sociedad's high pressing pushed PSG back at a subdued Parc des Princes. How the teams lined up Match stats Andre Silva glanced a header wide and captain Mikel Merino struck the crossbar with a superb dipping shot from 25 yards out moments before the break. Mbappe's goal took pressure off his team-mates and allowed the 21-year-old Barcola - a summer signing from Lyon - more freedom to attack.

""I'm extremely happy,"" Arteta told Sky Sports. ""The way we performed, the way we played. Such a big score in a really difficult place tells you a lot about how well the boys played today. ""It's great to make [club] history especially the way we have done it. We're in a good moment and when you have good moments you have to build and maintain the momentum. The team from the beginning looked really sharp. We had to put right the last two results against them and that was a good motivation for the boys.""

Speaking at half-time, Keane told Sky Sports: ""There are ways to lose a football match - West Ham have not turned up. ""They have not been physical, they are not tackling, no desire, no hunger, they look old and sluggish, they are not tracking back, no one has laid a glove on (Martin) Odegaard. ""Moyes must be fuming at half-time, but all credit to Arsenal, they look sharp and at it and have turned up. ""West Ham, though, a disgrace... shocking. I'm really frustrated with them. Arsenal are making the most of it. One or two touch, no one gets near them. Beautiful finish. Four nil. ""I can't believe what I'm watching. The way they get beaten physically, set-pieces... West Ham the last 10 or 15 minutes have been an absolute disgrace."" Merson added: ""Defending wise, if that happened in Under-10s football you'd be going, 'seriously?!' ""Not getting tight, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor, I just think Arsenal made West Ham surrender and that is quite sad as a player as that is the one thing you do not want to do. ""There is ways of losing football matches, that is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today. They work hard and the one thing you do not get done at West Ham is by set-plays, and they were poor with them today.""

Scott McTominay's late header in the 2-1 victory made it five wins and one draw from six matches in all competitions in 2024, with United now five points behind fifth-placed Villa in a major boost to their Champions League hopes. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports pundit Neville says United do have what it takes to finish above Villa in fifth, with Tottenham a point ahead of Unai Emery's side in fourth, but has played down the recent revival. ""They can claw it back,"" said Neville about United's Champions League ambitions. ""They've been appalling in the first half of the season. They've lost so many matches it's untrue. ""If they keep their players fit, which is a big question mark because it looks like they've lost another two with [Lisandro] Martinez and [Luke] Shaw in the past week, they have got a chance. Because of course they are better when they have their strength in their team. All teams are when they have their players back. ""The front three look more settled with [Marcus] Rashford, [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Rasmus] Hojlund with Bruno Fernandes in behind. ""They're better than they were but they're still not great.

But they do have players who can win matches. They are an odd bunch, I've said that for a few years, they play in moments during matches."" Meanwhile, Keane says Tottenham and Villa will be ""getting worried"" about United picking up results, but adds that Ten Hag's forwards are getting their defenders ""out of jail"". ""United still gave up loads of chances, the problems are still there for them,"" Keane said. ""They got away with it today, because the attacking players are scoring goals. ""But there's no surprise the amount of chances they give up, they do it every week. They've got away with it in three or four weeks. Their attacking players are getting them out of jail. ""The key for me is the attacking players are scoring goals. And what they've got, which Villa don't is that momentum. ""If you're in the Spurs and Villa dressing room and you see Man Utd coming up behind you, you're going to be worried. History will play a part, they've got the goals."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Amongst the goals is United striker Hojlund, who has scored once in each of his last five Premier League games since Boxing Day. Fellow Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson says the Danish forward, who failed to score a Premier League goal before Christmas in his debut season, is going to be a ""superstar"" after overcoming his early United struggles. ""I like him. He's a young kid, 21 playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. If there was one thing you could bottle up in football, you ask anyone, it's confidence,"" he said. ""In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it. ""If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""He's a good player, I think he will be a superstar."" Asked about Hojlund's improvement, Keane said: ""He's on fire, it took him a few months to get up to speed. He's part of a settled team now and he's got confidence. ""I believe every time he walks on the pitch, he thinks 'I'm going to score a goal for Man Utd'. It's a good return, considering the first few months he had. He's showing good form. ""You look at the lack of strikers at Man Utd. So the manager has been forced to play him week in and week out. ""The fact he's had to do that, and Ten Hag has had the option to take him out and give him a rest, is a big help."" If Manchester United are to make up more ground on the Champions League-chasing teams, they will look at the next few matches with fondness, says Neville. Ten Hag's side go to Luton next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Their next league away game after that is a daunting trip to title-chasing Manchester City, but around those games are home matches to bottom half clubs Fulham, Everton and Sheffield United. ""That's a great run of fixtures. If you forget the Man City game, those six games… they don't deserve anything if they don't pick up anything against those teams. ""I wouldn't be confident going to Luton next week, but them and Fulham [are winnable]. Every team gets beaten at the Etihad Stadium but then you have Everton and Sheffield United at home. ""In terms of the league games they've got, the four around the City game, you wouldn't say they're not favourable."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

264,"Women's FA Cup: Man City win at Arsenal, Chelsea edge Crystal Palace, Man Utd brush past Southampton",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/28508/13069636/womens-fa-cup-man-city-win-at-arsenal-chelsea-edge-crystal-palace-man-utd-brush-past-southampton,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Laia Aleixandri earned Manchester City a spot in the Women's FA Cup quarter-finals with a second-half winner against Arsenal. The Gunners came into the fifth-round contest hoping to bounce back from a first Women's Super League loss to West Ham, but could not find the finishing touch at Meadow Park as they crashed out 1-0. A scrappy first half gave way to a more open second period with chances for both sides, WSL leading goalscorer Khadija Shaw seeing two headed efforts kept out, first by Arsenal keeper Sabrina D'Angelo then by defender Leah Williamson in her second start since returning from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury. Shaw, in a worrying sight for City boss Gareth Taylor, was forced off and replaced by Mary Fowler in the 67th minute, shortly before Gunners substitute Steph Catley failed to clear Chloe Kelly's free-kick and Spain international Aleixandri pounced, poking in the 74th-minute winner. Khiara Keating's stunning series of saves against a late Arsenal surge preserved the visiting side's lead, and while the Gunners felt the City keeper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line, the officials disagreed. Holders Chelsea took one step closer to securing a fourth straight FA Cup crown with a 1-0 victory over Championship side Crystal Palace at Kingsmeadow thanks a superb maiden goal from January signing Mayra Ramirez. Emma Hayes had initially changed all 11 players from the side that beat Sunderland 5-0 in their midweek Conti Cup clash, but Fran Kirby returned as a replacement for Lauren James, who was a late withdrawal from the line-up. It was a valiant performance from Palace, who held the hosts to a goalless draw for 81 minutes, when Ramirez opened her Blues account with a brilliant backheeled flick to book her side another trip into the last eight. There were wild scenes at Wolverhampton when Beth Merrick's 67th-minute penalty for Wolves - one of two third-tier sides remaining - cancelled out Katie Robinson's first-half opener for relegation-threatened WSL side Brighton. The teams remained on level terms until Emma Kullberg's first goal for Brighton fired the Seagulls into an 88th-minute lead, before the Sweden international then completed her hat-trick inside a stunning eight minutes. Manchester United, last season's runners-up, claimed a 3-1 victory over Championship outfit Southampton, with Rachel Williams heading home twice after Lexi Lloyd-Smith had cancelled out Ella Toone's eighth-minute opener. Kit Graham's low, long-range effort in the 76th minute of Tottenham's 1-0 victory over Charlton spelled the end of the Championship leaders' cup run, while goals from Sophie Roman Haug and Melissa Lawley secured Liverpool a 2-0 win over London City Lionesses. Leicester shrugged off the shock of conceding an early goal to beat Birmingham 6-2 and cruise into the Women's FA Cup quarter-finals. A Missy Goodwin own goal put the Championship side in front after just two minutes, but goals from Janice Cayman and Shannon O'Brien quickly turned the tie on its head. Libby Smith levelled for the visitors just before the break, but further goals from O'Brien, Saori Takarada, Deanne Rose and Aileen Whelan saw Leicester home.

266,Bukayo Saka reaches half-century for Arsenal with more goals and assists than Cristiano Ronaldo in first 210 games,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/13071635/bukayo-saka-reaches-half-century-for-arsenal-with-more-goals-and-assists-than-cristiano-ronaldo-in-first-210-games,Nick Wright,Publish time not found,"With his first-half penalty and well-taken second in Sunday's 6-0 win over West Ham, Bukayo Saka became the youngest Arsenal player in the Premier League era to hit the 50-goal mark. The milestone was reached with another outstanding display from the academy graduate. Not that there was much self-congratulation afterwards. ""I'm not sure I can be happy today,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I missed some chances I could have scored."" His comments offered a glimpse into the mentality driving his continued progress at Arsenal. Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, was eager to emphasise the magnitude of what he is achieving at 22. ""At his age, the position and consistency normally don't go in the same line,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He is proving everybody wrong, that he can do it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His numbers for the season now stand at 13 goals and 12 assists in 31 games in all competitions, a combined total of 25 putting him behind only six players, among them Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah, across Europe's major leagues. He is in good company in that list. With the exception of the ludicrous Jude Bellingham, it is worth noting Saka, still six months shy of his 23rd birthday, is the youngest name to feature. Arteta has faced questions about the risks of overplaying Saka in the last three seasons, a period during which he has only missed one Premier League game. But his record speaks for itself. Arsenal's fixtures Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports with NOW In a total of 210 appearances for Arsenal, he has scored 51 goals and provided 49 assists. Remarkably, it is a superior return to Cristiano Ronaldo after the same number of games. It would be foolish, of course, to assume he will therefore emulate the extraordinary achievements of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. But to be ahead of him in terms of goals and assists is an incredible feat which further underlines his world-class potential - if he is not at that level already, that is. There is further encouragement to be found when comparing Saka's record to those of some of the Premier League's best wide forwards in more recent years at the same age. Saka has provided nearly 40 per cent more goals and assists than Raheem Sterling, for example, having played one game fewer than the former Liverpool and Manchester City man. His numbers are higher than those of Marcus Rashford, Leroy Sane and Heung-Min Son too. Salah, meanwhile, was yet to even make a mark in a major European league having played for Swiss side Basel until the age of 21, then been a bit-part player at Chelsea. For further context, Salah's former Liverpool team-mate Sadio Mane was yet to play in a major European league at all having only just joined Southampton from Red Bull Salzburg at Saka's age. The Arsenal forward is way ahead of schedule, comparatively, and his numbers are all the more impressive given he was used mostly as a left-back in his first 18 months in the side. ""It took me a while to figure him out,"" explained Arteta in conversation with Sky Sports in April 2021. ""That's why I tried to play him in different positions, to see how he reacted. ""I wanted to test his character as well because he was playing as a left-back and I know it wasn't his ideal position, but he had to go through that period."" Saka came through it with flying colours, subsequently becoming an unmoveable presence on the right-hand side of Arsenal's attack. He has embraced the responsibility of being a talismanic figure in a team that remains one of youngest in the Premier League. From one season to the next, his output has increased significantly as his all-round game has continued to improve. Now, with three months of the current campaign still to play, he is on course to smash his previous best total of 26 goals and assists. It is a measure of how much we have come to expect from him that, even in the context of such impressive numbers, his form has at times come under scrutiny this season, most notably during a run of one goal in 11 Premier League games before Christmas. But carry on scoring and assisting at his current rate, with 14 Premier League games still to play and as many as seven Champions League fixtures to come too, and Saka could end up with a total north of 40. His pattern of improvement becomes even clearer when looking deeper into the numbers. This season, Saka is creating more chances and taking more shots than at any point in his career. It is only natural, then, that he is scoring and assisting more, especially given the positions he is getting into. His numbers for touches in the opposition box are trending in the same direction as Arteta continually seeks to maximise his attacking threat. There will come a point when Saka's minutes need to be managed more carefully in order to avoid burnout and ensure longevity. He has played an extraordinary number of minutes for someone so young. Another right-sided forward will be needed to share the load. But at only 22, and as determined as ever to continue improving, it seems Arsenal's half-centurion is just getting started. It is a tantalising thought given the level he has already reached.

267,Mauricio Pochettino critical of his Chelsea players and himself after defeat against Wolves,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13064276/mauricio-pochettino-critical-of-his-chelsea-players-and-himself-after-defeat-against-wolves,Ron Walker,Publish time not found,"Mauricio Pochettino issued a damning takedown of himself and his Chelsea side's season by saying ""we are all not good enough"" after their 4-2 home defeat to Wolves. Pochettino's side fell to a 10th defeat from 23 league games this season as Wolves leapfrogged them into the top half of the Premier League with a convincing win - the visitors' first at Stamford Bridge in more than 40 years. Chelsea shipped four goals for the second time in four days after they were humbled 4-1 at Liverpool on Wednesday night, and faced the wrath of their home support at the end of both halves of a game where they barely laid a glove on their opponents, who had been tipped for relegation at the start of the season. ""I think we are all not good enough, that's the reality,"" Pochettino said. ""Myself also, as the first person responsible. Of course, what we showed today was that we are not good enough. I agree, 100 per cent. ""We didn't manage the situation properly, and I don't want to come here and say I am the best and the players are the worst - but the players have to take responsibility as I do. ""We are not matching the history of the club. We need to accept it and be critical, but we cannot give up. We have to keep working, try hard to change, take decisions to try to find things in a different way if it's not working in this way and find different solutions.""

""What you can say is to apologise for the fans,"" he said. ""Perception is one thing and that's that Chelsea should be in a different position, but for different circumstances we are not there. ""What we can do is, most importantly, to feel the responsibility and of course we need to accept the organisation and the players we have. ""Then to understand the fans is really important. We want to apologise and feel sorry. We are disappointed like them but we need to fight altogether. If we want to take good results in the future, we have to stay together. ""During the 90 minutes, we need to work together to get a good result, and in the end they will be right to criticise or be angry if the performance is not good. ""The players are young, they need support, and I need to thank the fans who stayed until the end because they were supporting, and then at the end they are entitled to behave how they want to. ""We need to feel the confidence, to feel fresh to compete again. They need help from the fans during the 90 minutes and it's not to demand anything, but it's easy to sit outside watching the players run and play, and then when the stress arrives it is not easy. ""But it's why now what we need to do is be behind them and help them recover from these two defeats."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking on Sky Sports, Jamie O'Hara was stunned by Pochettino's side, saying: ""Chelsea... wow. There are players there on eight-year contracts. I wouldn't give them one-year contracts. ""Mudryk, £70m? He isn't worth £7 right now. He gave the ball away 15 times when he came on. Absolutely shocking. If you're a Chelsea fan, you'd be ashamed watching your side. ""They have fallen so far away from their previous standards, winning Premier Leagues, Champions Leagues. You go to Stamford Bridge and you never got a chance, you never had a shot on goal. ""Now you turn up at the Bridge and think 'here we go', rubbing your hands together. They are miles off it. ""They don't want to be there, half of them. They just want to play nice football like a reserve team, like there is nothing riding on it. ""Three points is everything in the Premier League. They are 11th! One of the worst teams I've seen this season. Awful."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wolves manager Gary O'Neil was impressed with the way his players picked themselves up from conceding an injury-time winner at Manchester United on Thursday night, to recover from Chelsea's early opener and put their hosts to the sword at Stamford Bridge. Wolves turned the game on its head before half-time and stepped up their performance after it, scoring a third just after the hour before Matheus Cunha wrapped up a hat-trick from the penalty spot seven minutes from time. He said: ""The lads deserve an awful lot of credit to be able to put in that kind of performance physically, to be able to emotionally recover from that setback on Thursday. ""To fight back to 3-3 against Man Utd and then concede a fourth, then go down 1-0 here, it would've been very easy to accept a Chelsea win everyone was expecting, but everyone managed to dig in and fight back, and stick together. ""I'm unbelievably proud of the players and the staff. In the summer we signed three players, and lost a lot of players. In January we weren't able to strengthen, so everyone at the football club understands we need to maximise everything. ""We need to pull together from people working in the offices and the organisation, to the medical team who know I can't rotate the team much, so we have to go Thursday-Sunday. The work that goes in from everyone, I'm extremely grateful."" He revealed Cunha, whose hat-trick guaranteed his most prolific league season since his debut campaign in Europe with Sion in 2018/19, had come to see him after the Man Utd defeat to work on parts of his game. Their conversations reaped the perfect reward as he became the first Wolves player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Diogo Jota in 2019. ""We've spoken a lot about how talented he is,"" O'Neil said. ""He came to see me the morning after the Man Utd game to have a few words about the match and his game. He's a great guy who wants to improve things, and understand. ""All we've managed to do is turn an unbelievably talented player into an unbelievably talented player who has a real good understanding tactically of how things can be, the positions he can take up and he deserves huge credit. A Premier League hat-trick, especially at Stamford Bridge, is one to remember."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6. Entries by 3pm Saturday."
268,SPFL: Governance review sent to clubs and meeting set after top-flight clubs raised concerns,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11781/13066676/spfl-rangers-aberdeen-motherwell-st-mirren-st-johnstone-and-livingston-demand-answers-on-governance-report,Author not found,Publish time not found,"The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is ""confident"" any concerns raised by six top-flight clubs over an independent governance review will be answered after sharing the findings with all 42 members. Aberdeen, Livingston, Motherwell, Rangers, St Johnstone and St Mirren expressed ""serious concerns"" over the ""independence and transparency"" of the report and wanted ""full clarity on numerous issues"" to clarify if ""further action is necessary"". League Two side Stenhousemuir then backed the six Premiership clubs who called for a meeting to discuss the issues on February 27, but the SPFL has now confirmed all clubs will gather instead on March 19. The independent review was commissioned after SPFL chair Murdoch MacLennan apologised to Rangers following a lengthy dispute about its main sponsorship deal. In January the SPFL announced a draft report following the three-month review showed it complied ""with significant elements of the UK Code of Corporate Governance"", with MacLennan adding he was ""reassured, but not complacent"". The review was carried out by independent external auditors and involved detailed questionnaires and interviews with 15 stakeholders, including senior executive team members, non-executive directors, and other senior figures in the game. The six clubs, however, released a joint letter with concerns over the ""independence and transparency"" of the report, plus the overall governance of the SPFL and questioned questioning why the executive were able to amend the original draft of the report before it was presented to the rest of the board. Stream the Scottish Premiership & more with NOW Get Sky Sports Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures The SPFL cited ""a number of factual inaccuracies"" in the letter which also claimed MacLennan's statement following the completion of the report ""was issued without the approval or knowledge"" of the SPFL board and member clubs. Furthermore, some clubs were concerned MacLennan's statement was not a true reflection of the report. Sky Sports News understands there were also concerns that outside of current or previous SPFL members just one club, Aberdeen, were allowed any input into the auditing process, and, despite several requests at the time, the full report was not yet released to any of the clubs who paid for it. While the six top-flight clubs wanted a meeting in February for all 42 members to discuss concerns around the report, the SPFL has confirmed a board meeting will now take place on March 19. ""We are pleased that, following further discussion with Henderson Loggie, we have now been able to circulate their independent governance review in its entirety to all 42 SPFL clubs. Now that clubs are in possession of the review, we are confident they will see for themselves how thorough and detailed the exercise was - and that Henderson Loggie have delivered in full on the brief announced in July 2023. ""Henderson Loggie's report contains a number of recommendations for the board's consideration. ""The board had hoped to consider all of Henderson Loggie's recommendations at its scheduled meeting on Monday 19 February. However, one director requested that this discussion be put back to allow all board members to attend. That meeting, to discuss the individual recommendations, is therefore scheduled to take place on 19 March, which is the first date after 19 February that all SPFL board members can be there in person. ""Given the ongoing public debate, however, we are keen that clubs and the board are able to discuss the review at the earliest possible date. A scheduled meeting of Premiership clubs will take place on the morning of Monday 19 February and the governance review is already on the agenda. The SPFL board is meeting later that day and its agenda also includes the governance review. As well as the Premiership club meeting, we intend to schedule further meetings in the weeks ahead, to enable all clubs to have their views heard, and their questions answered, at the earliest opportunity. The board will discuss the timing of those meetings on Monday. ""In addition, we intend to call a general meeting of all 42 clubs, in line with the SPFL's articles, where our shareholders will be given ample opportunity to consider the board's proposals in respect of Henderson Loggie's recommendations, as soon as possible after 19 March."" ""On behalf of SPFL Premiership clubs Aberdeen, Motherwell, Livingston, Rangers, St Johnstone and St Mirren, a letter was today issued to the SPFL executive in response to the handling of the recent Independent Governance report. ""The clubs hold serious concerns regarding the report's independence, transparency, and the overall governance of the SPFL. ""The letter seeks full clarity on numerous issues so that the clubs, as shareholders of the SPFL, can determine if further action is necessary. ""In conjunction with a draft report being made available to the SPFL board, SPFL chairman Murdoch MacLennan hastily released a statement that did not reflect the full findings of the report. ""Additionally, the statement was issued without the approval or knowledge of members of the SPFL board or SPFL member clubs. ""The SPFL board is to meet at a future date to discuss the draft report's contents, making it highly inappropriate for the SPFL chairman to have made any public comment ahead of that meeting. ""Regarding the report itself, the clubs and others are deeply concerned about its independence, given that the SPFL executive received the first draft of the report and made changes to it prior to sending it to SPFL board members. ""Of the 42 member clubs, only one had the opportunity to input into the report's investigation, outside of current or previous SPFL board members. ""Despite several requests from the clubs, the report has yet to be released to any of the member clubs despite the clubs footing the bill for its creation. ""The handling of the Independent Governance report has brought the clubs' governance concerns to a head, and it is now incumbent on the SPFL board and executive, for the sake of trust in those running our game, to provide clarity over these clear and deeply troubling concerns as a matter of urgency.""

269,Arsenal Women: Jonas Eidevall's side need better conversion rate or risk falling out of WSL title contention,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/13070760/arsenal-women-jonas-eidevalls-side-need-better-conversion-rate-or-risk-falling-out-of-wsl-title-contention,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Jonas Eidevall has called it a 'sin'. The stats back him up. He is referring to Arsenal's tendency, intentional or not, to indulge style over substance. Their failure to convert dominance into goals. It's been a problem plaguing the Gunners for seasons, pre-dating Eidevall's tenure, but one that threatens to cling onto this term's title challenge like a bad smell. ""We're back a little bit to some of the sins earlier in the season, where on the chances we get, we don't get shots on target,"" Eidevall said ponderously after Arsenal's third WSL loss of the season two weekends ago. It appears to be a reccurring theme. The weight of expectation on Arsenal, and Eidevall, to deliver trophies this season feels heavier and more burdensome than ever before. The reasons for that are multifaceted, and many have been calculated elsewhere on these pages, but adequate context requires a few finer details to be declared here. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal have found a way to be consistently creative, playing attractive and expansive football, without the corresponding end product.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  To confuse matters, and for suitable balance, there is a huge amount to like about this Arsenal side, if only they could put the ball in the back of the net more consistently. It's here where the stats are most exposing. Across the past three WSL campaigns (up to and including the most recent matchday), Arsenal have ranked second, behind Chelsea, for big chances created (50.3 per season), but first for big chances missed (28.3 per season). Again, only Chelsea (243) can boast a better record than Arsenal (233) for shots attempted this term, yet Arsenal rank fifth in the charts for shots on target (6.1 per game). Their shot conversion rate (11.3 per cent) puts them seventh. It runs deeper. Arsenal lead the way in corners won and possession wins in the final third, and are second (again behind Chelsea) for touches in the opposition box (533), but rank fourth for average goals scored per game (2.2). The numbers don't tally. They have the second-best 'big chance' creator in the league in Victoria Pelova but no closer. No player with a 'scruff of the neck' attitude who can turn a game in an instant - at least not with enough regularity. The Gunners' top scorer this term is Alessia Russo, who has hit the net five times; her goal conversion rate is 18 per cent, while Man City's Bunny Shaw, who has scored 13 times, boasts a conversion rate of 33 per cent. Chelsea's Lauren James has 12 goals and has also converted 33 per cent of her chances. That's no slight on Russo herself, but illustrative of Arsenal's struggles more broadly. Arsenal's shot conversion rate of 11.3 per cent ranks seventh-best in the WSL, and is far lower than top four rivals. There's a softness that underpins Eidevall's side. A lack of ruthlessness and clinical edge that will prevent them from realising the ultimate dream of beating Chelsea to WSL gold. The same can be said of the way they were dumped unceremoniously out of the FA Cup by Manchester City last Sunday, losing 1-0. Adding insult to injury. Williamson returns to Lionesses squad And yet, sandwiched between all the stats that suggest the Gunners' performance in final third is inhibiting progress, is an individual result that disrupted the pattern. An offer of hope and promise. A performance that prompted this journalist to write about them as the team to beat this term - the ones driving the title agenda. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal produced their most complete performance under Eidevall back in December, beating Chelsea 4-1, outperforming their xG (2.97) for only the fourth time this season. The atmosphere created by a record WSL crowd inside Emirates Stadium matched the spark on the pitch and goals flowed as a result. The football was breathtaking. Arsenal drew level on points at the top of the league with their London rivals that day and dented more than just egos. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""That's as bad as I've seen us for a long time,"" Hayes said post-match. ""They bullied us."" Chelsea, so often the aggressors, getting tormented by Arsenal's attacking efficiency felt like a moment. A turning point. A curious shift in energy. Maybe this is the Gunners' time, many promptly - and prematurely - surmised. Alas, a regular scourge has reared its ugly head in recent weeks. Failing to capitalise on that obvious power switch may be Eidevall's biggest regret yet. Something's amiss. Arsenal have lost two of their last four WSL games and will be looking to avoid suffering consecutive
defeats for the first time this season against Man Utd on Saturday. Arsenal have underperformed against their xG in three of four league games since beating Chelsea. Against Tottenham the following week their expected goals tally reached 2.52 and they lost 1-0. Their most recent WSL outing, a 2-1 defeat at West Ham, was equally underwhelming. The Hammers had never beaten Arsenal before. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We created enough chances to turn the game around, but we didn't put the ball away,"" said Eidevall, not for the first time, likely not for the last. Even Arsenal's set-piece xG is the best in the league (6.58). It's like getting all the way through a joke and stumbling over the punchline. A front four of Caitlin Foord, Viv Miedema, Beth Mead and Russo are capable of so much more and Eidevall, a deep, analytical thinker, will be busy examining how he can tap into their unrealised threat. How best to put those players in positions where scoring is inexorable. Arsenal are winless in four straight WSL games against Manchester United (D2 L2), since a 2-0 away win in November 2021. For all their beautiful approach play, intricate passing triangles, and movement into opposition boxes, finishing continues to let this enterprising Arsenal side down. This recent streak is just the latest example. WSL winners, as Chelsea have proven time again, learn from their shortcomings. If Arsenal are going to deal with theirs, in time to re-enter the title picture, it's going to have to be now.

270,Bayern Munich 3-1 Borussia Monchengladbach: Harry Kane equals record with 24th Bundesliga goal of season,https://www.skysports.com/football/bay-munich-vs-mgladbach/report/488504,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Harry Kane scored his 24th Bundesliga goal in Bayern Munich’s 3-1 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach to equal a club record as the highest scorer in a debut season. Thomas Tuchel's side remain two points behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who they play next weekend live on Sky Sports, after coming from behind at the Allianz Arena. Nico Elvedi gave Gladbach a shock lead in the first half after Bayern had squandered several chances, but Aleksandar Pavlovic equalised just before the break. The hosts struggled to create clear chances in the second half but Kane pounced on a mistake from Gladbach goalkeeper Moritz Nicolas to move level with Luca Toni's record from 2007 before Matthijs de Ligt secured the points late on. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leroy Sane had two big chances to open the scoring inside 10 minutes. He crashed a shot against the crossbar from just inside the box before then dinking wide from little more than six yards. Kane was denied by a wonderful save from Nicolas at a free-kick before Gladbach enjoyed a fruitful five-minute spell. Eric Dier was forced to clear off the line and then Nathan Ngoumou headed wide, but Elvedi found the net with their third attempt. The defender stepped forward to win the ball off Thomas Muller in the Bayern half and played a one-two with Jordan Siebatcheu before slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner.

Bayern looked to be drifting towards a disappointing draw during the second period until Kane capitalised on Nicolas's error in the 70th minute. And De Ligt sealed the win with a header of his own which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar. Alphonso Davies has emerged as a major doubt for Bayern Munich's crunch Bundesliga clash with Bayer Leverkusen next Saturday. Bayern have confirmed Davies suffered a strained medial knee ligament in the win over Borussia Monchengladbach and is waiting on the results of a scan to determine how long his absence will be. He pulled up after making a clearance in the closing stages of the 3-1 win and had to be replaced by Raphael Guerreiro after receiving treatment. Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel revealed there was a chance Joshua Kimmich (shoulder) and Dayot Upamecano (hamstring) might be able to face current leaders Leverkusen if they pass fitness tests during the week. Bayern are already without Serge Gnabry (hamstring), Bouna Sarr and Daniel Peretz (both knee) while Kingsley Coman (knee) is another long-term absentee and Kim Min-jae remains on Asian Cup duty with South Korea.

271,IFAB delays plans to publish details of blue card and sin-bin trials until March,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13067454/ifab-delays-plans-to-publish-details-of-blue-card-and-sin-bin-trials-until-march,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Football's lawmakers have delayed plans to publish details of sin-bin trials - which were expected to include the introduction of blue cards - at higher levels of football until next month. Trial protocols on sin-bins, plus other measures to combat poor player behaviour, were expected to be published on Friday, but it is understood they will now be the subject of further discussion at the International Football Association Board (IFAB]'s annual general meeting at Loch Lomond on March 2. IFAB has chosen to delay the publication of the proposals to allow more time for discussion. Sin-bins have been used in grassroots football successfully for a number of years but IFAB indicated at its annual business meeting in November a willingness to test them at higher levels. It is understood that in these planned trials players would be shown blue cards for dissent and tactical fouls, such as Giorgio Chiellini's cynical tug on Bukayo Saka for Italy against England in the Euro 2020 final. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The introduction of a blue card, if it passed into the laws of the game, would mark the biggest single change in managing player discipline since red and yellow cards came into force at the 1970 World Cup. It is understood the plan was not to test sin-bins in top-level competitions initially but to stress test them in lower-level events. Future of Football: Rule changes you wanted to see... and ones you didn't Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! This is understood to be because of concerns about the impact on players coping with different rules being used in a domestic league and a continental competition, for instance. It is unclear precisely what level IFAB had in mind for these trials but certainly a higher level than the grassroots game. The agenda for next month's AGM - published earlier this week - confirmed discussions would be held on the trials approved at November's ABM for sin-bins, captain-only zones around referees and the testing of cooling-off periods as a means for managing mass confrontations. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There is also due to be a discussion around a new trial on how best to tackle the problem of goalkeepers holding on to the ball for too long. FIFA posted on X on Thursday night to say that reports around the use of blue cards in elite football were ""incorrect and premature"". The global governing body added: ""Any such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when this agenda item is discussed at the IFAB AGM on March 2."" Sin-bins were introduced across all levels of grassroots football from the 2019/20 season in an attempt to improve levels of respect and fair play in the game. The rule change was implemented up to step five of the National League system and tier three and below in women's football. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Managers had their say on the potential introduction of blue cards on Friday - and were less than enthusiastic. Jurgen Klopp argued: ""The introduction of a new card would just give more opportunities to fail because the discussion then would be, 'should it have been a blue card, or a yellow card?' ""It does not sound like a fantastic idea but I can't remember when the last fantastic idea came from these guys, [or] if they ever had one."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mauricio Pochettino echoed Klopp's thoughts, saying: ""I think it is going to create more divides, be more complicated to the referees, the players and the fans. My feeling now is that it's not a good idea but we'll see what happens. ""Give it an opportunity to see how it works and after to have a better idea about how they want to apply it during the game. Ange Postecoglou: ""One team being down to 10 men for 10 minutes, you know what it's going to do to our game? It's going to destroy it, mate. ""You're going to have one team just sitting there trying to waste time for 10 minutes waiting for a guy to come on. ""Every other sport is trying to declutter. All we're trying to do is go the other way for some bizarre reason."" Mikel Arteta said the tests need to be rigorous before blue cards are introduced into the elite game, saying: ""I don't know if we're going to get there. We've got a lot going on now with decisions, with technology - I don't know if we're ready for that yet! ""Hopefully it's going to be tested very, very well before it's introduced at this level."" Jonas Eidevall suggested the lack of application of the rule preventing goalkeepers from holding the ball for more than six seconds was a bigger issue, saying: ""There is one rule in football that takes time into account as a consequence at the moment - it's the amount of time that the goalkeeper can control the ball with his or her hands. That's very clearly stipulated in the law of the game that it needs to be six seconds. ""If you see how that law is followed by the referees, I think that there's room for improvement."" Brendan Rodgers joked the introduction of a blue card would cause additional problems in Scotland, with the Celtic boss saying: ""As soon as I saw it I thought 'I work in Scotland so I'm sure they better have a green card as well as a blue one or we might be in trouble'. ""Just don't complicate it. Just make a decision whether it's a red, yellow or no card. We don't need a blue card up here, that's for sure.""

Declan Rice's long-range goal capped a stunning demolition of his former side West Ham as Arsenal claimed a 6-0 win at the London Stadium. The extraordinary victory, Arsenal's biggest in a Premier League away game, puts the Gunners level with second-placed Manchester City on goal difference, maintaining their title hopes following last Sunday's win over Liverpool. Neville, speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast, admitted he wants to see Arsenal go all the way this season and that it would be good for the Premier League if the Manchester City and Liverpool era of dominance was broken. He said: ""For Arteta to break Klopp and Guardiola would be huge for the Premier League - we want disruption. ""Manchester City have been incredible, Guardiola is a genius and Klopp is the best manager over the last six years having worked against Guardiola with the resources that's he had. If Arteta could drive through the middle of them it would be monumental. I can't wait for the next three months. I want them to be controlled. To be determined. And to know there is a long way to go."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal were criticised by Jamie Carragher following their win over Liverpool for over-celebrating, with Carragher saying: ""You've won a game - get down the tunnel."" Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! It was a debate that raged on during the build-up to Arsenal's game with West Ham and Neville has called on the Gunners to tone down the hype of their post-match celebrations in order to reserve emotional energy for the run-in. He added: ""There has been lots of jokes made this week about over-celebrating, but it's a serious topic. ""Emotion and passion can sap energy, particularly if you are over-enthusiastic. ""From someone that is qualified in these kinds of things, if you use up too much emotion and are overhyped, it does sap energy. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Against Bournemouth last season - about 10-12 games out - Zinchenko was screaming at the fans in his car 120 minutes after full-time. If you're using up that level of emotion, imagine what we aren't seeing. You can read into the impact of that heightened feeling. Arsenal have got a great chance - they've got a great team, a great manager, the back four are solid, the midfield are strong and the front players are such a threat. ""When you score a goal, celebrate for your life, but at the end of the game, treat it as if it's one game down. Keep that control of getting the job done. They need to manage the last few months of the season really well and focus on the job."" ""They are the team that are closest to Man City. Liverpool have a great manager but I feel Arsenal are a better team. There is so much energy and passion at Arsenal, that's great, but we're now entering into a run-in. When you think of Floyd Mayweather and Muhammad Ali - boxers who used to call it on with their enthusiasm. ""They were so great they could do it. Arsenal aren't in that position to be like that. It's helped them that they've not been in front and had no pressure or expectation. They need to sit there, sit there, sit there, and pounce at the end. That's how they'll need to win the league. Last season I never thought they'd win the league, this year they can. They have more control. I'm feeling it for them."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville was also full of praise for Declan Rice after the England midfielder grabbed a goal and two assists for the Gunners against his former side West Ham. ""Rice is a very rare player,"" Neville told Sky Sports. ""When I played, you had Roy Keane, Steven Gerrard and Patrick Vieira, players who had power and force to go and get their foot in and take the ball off players. ""Rice has about him. He gets to players so quickly and he makes up that ground with those long strides. He's an animal in there. ""He's a force in the middle of the park and it is something that is so rare."" Neville also believes Rice's presence for Arsenal means they can play Jorginho, who produced a man-of-the-match display against Liverpool a couple of weeks ago. ""Rice's presence also allows Arsenal to play Jorginho, who can bring real composure in big games. Rice has the legs that can cover for Jorginho's lack of legs. ""There were a couple of times last season when Jorginho was playing where he just looked too slow. ""It's a bit like that with Casemiro at Manchester United. He's better with Kobbie Mainoo alongside him. Earlier in the season, he was in there on his own alongside Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes and it looked like he couldn't get across midfield. ""For Arsenal, with Rice there, you always feel he will get to where he needs to be on the pitch. ""Vieira was like that for Arsenal for years. They just cover the ground so well and it was unbelievable what he used to be able to do."" Meanwhile, former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane believes Arsenal are more equipped to win the title this season because of Rice. ""Players like Declan, with that physical presence in there, he makes a big difference,"" Keane told Sky Sports. ""The quality we've seen from set-pieces and the goals they've scored, particularly against West Ham, also make a big difference. ""It's always really important for any of the top teams to be good at set-pieces. Liverpool are good at it and so are City. ""Set-pieces are a huge part of football and we saw that again for Arsenal at West Ham. Rice gets the ball into a good area and you've got big strong players attacking it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Rice is going to have a big part to play for Arsenal to win the title,"" Keane added. ""He plays every week. You cannot underestimate that. He's available to the manager week in, week out, as he was at West Ham too. He's a big player for Arsenal and he's not missing two or three games here or there. He's always there. ""We've obviously seen his quality with set piece delivery and his goal, but it is his physical presence that makes a big difference.

The 26-year-old defender sustained the injury during Manchester United's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday February 4, after which Erik ten Hag admitted the issue could be ""very bad"" and was a ""personal disaster"". Martinez suffered the injury when tangling with Vladimir Coufal as he attempted to shield the ball out for a goal-kick in the second half at Old Trafford and was replaced shortly afterwards. Martinez initially tried to play on after the incident but soon pulled up again before trudging off the pitch, and United confirmed the nature of the injury in a statement on Monday evening. A Man Utd statement said: ""Lisandro Martinez has sustained an injury to the medial collateral ligament in his knee and is expected to be out of action for at least eight weeks.

""We have centre-backs who can fill in but he brings spirit to the team, apart from his football abilities.""

""I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable."" Moyes even highlighted a key moment in the game when Emerson was running through on the angle after dispossessing Harry Maguire.

276,Emiliano Sala: Cardiff City and football agent Willie McKay reach agreement five years after plane disaster,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11688/13066149/emiliano-sala-cardiff-city-and-football-agent-willie-mckay-reach-agreement-five-years-after-plane-disaster,Author not found,Publish time not found,"Cardiff City and football agent Willie McKay have reached an out-of-court agreement over his involvement in the 2019 Emiliano Sala transfer, on the eve of the first day of their hearing. Sky Sports News previously reported McKay was being sued by Cardiff in order to obtain information about his involvement in the Sala deal. Sala was due to complete a club-record fee to Cardiff from Nantes during the January transfer window but died after his private plane crashed over the English Channel. Sky Sports News has previously reported McKay and his son arranged the private plane for Sala. In June 2023, Cardiff launched legal proceedings against Nantes in France, where they are seeking damages for the transfer and as part of the proceedings in France, the club were attempting to sue McKay to understand his involvement in the transfer. According to a source close to the case, Cardiff also argue they would have avoided relegation if Sala had played for the club and are seeking damages for losses in revenue from the relegation. As part of the proceedings in France, Nantes claim McKay had no involvement in the transfer, which Cardiff dispute. A hearing was due to take place on February 8, but Sky Sports News has been told this hearing was canceled after the parties reached an out-of-court agreement. The terms of the agreement are confidential. Sky Sports News attended a preliminary hearing last week, where McKay failed to have the proceedings delayed. A statement from Willie McKay said: ""Out of respect for the family of Emiliano Sala, I felt it was necessary to confirm that Cardiff City FC have reached an agreement with me regarding their claim against Nantes FC. ""I have, throughout this process, provided evidence to assist the Dorset Coroner, Dorset Police, Civil Aviation Authority and the Air Accidents Investigation Board and, always acted openly and honestly during all the investigations into the tragic death of Emiliano. ""My family and myself, have endured endless unfounded allegations and accusations, but we have always known that we were innocent of any wrongdoing. Throughout all the above investigations, we have been found to be innocent of any wrongdoing of any kind leading up to the awful events on the 21 January 2019."" Capital Law, lawyers for Cardiff City, told Sky Sports News: ""The club is pleased with the outcome and remains committed to recovering the losses it has suffered as a result of FCN's negligence."""

City extended their unbeaten run in Europe to 21 matches and will return to the Etihad on March 6 for the second leg, in between crucial Premier League fixtures against Manchester United and Liverpool, both live on Sky Sports, to continue their title defence. Kevin De Bruyne struck the opener after just 10 minutes amid a dominant start which should have seen them further ahead before Jack Grealish went off injured and an Ederson mistake allowed Copenhagen's Magnus Mattsson to equalise. But Bernardo Silva struck in added time of the first half to restore their lead and after Erling Haaland had hit the crossbar, and been denied by goalkeeper Kamil Grabara, Foden netted in the 92nd minute to move City closer to the quarter-finals. Copenhagen:  Grabara (7), McKenna (6), Vavro (6), Diks (5), Jelert (6), Mattsson (7), Jensen (6), Goncalves (6), Elyounoussi (6), Claesson (6), Achouri (6).


Subs: Cornelius (6), Hojlund (6), Sorensen (n/a), Larsson (n/a)


Man City:  Ederson (5), Walker (7), Stones (7), Dias (7), Ake (7), Rodri (7), De Bruyne (8), Silva (8), Foden (8), Grealish (6), Haaland (7).


Subs: Doku (7), Nunes (n/a)


Player of the Match: Phil Foden Man City could have scored twice in the opening 10 minutes before De Bruyne gave them the lead. The midfielder glanced a header wide when well positioned in the box before Nathan Ake hooked over from close range, but De Bruyne soon clinically fired across the goalkeeper and into the bottom left corner from a tight angle. City had over 80 per cent possession in a dominant opening 20 minutes but were dealt a blow when Grealish was forced off and were then within inches of a second as Copenhagen centre-back Denis Vavro headed against his own crossbar. Ederson had barely touched the ball until he gifted the hosts a way back into the game. The goalkeeper played a stray pass out to Mohamed Elyounoussi and the ricochet from his blocked shot was curled home from the edge of the box by debutant Mattsson. Champions League fixtures Champions League results Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! Download the Sky Sports App Mattsson then volleyed over from inside the City area before being involved in a fortunate second for the visitors. In a tackle with De Bruyne, the ball ricocheted perfectly through to Silva, who flicked it past the goalkeeper. City started the second half slowly, finding opportunities harder to come by with only De Bruyne's shot from outside the area having to be tipped around the right post. Ake had to be alert to clear Elyounoussi's cross which substitute Andreas Cornelius was waiting to turn home before Grabara flung to his left to parry Jeremy Doku's powerful effort. City pushed hard for a third in the final 15 minutes, seeing Haaland denied on three occasions with a deflected header striking the crossbar before Grabara saved twice. The goalkeeper, though, was finally beaten again as De Bruyne pulled the ball back from the byline for Foden to slot. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola speaking to TNT Sports: ""Really, really good, so proud. It was important. Today was perfect. They were patient in the right moments. Really good. I'm really proud of the team. The third goal helped us a lot. Hopefully, we can finish it off at home and go to the next game. ""It was important to not lose the tie here. The game was really well played from the first minute. We conceded a goal but sometimes that happens. ""In the second half, they played with five in the back but in general we did well. We didn't concede transitions or make the crowd support the team... We had the perfect tempo so really pleased."" On Kevin De Bruyne's impact since returning: ""Yeah, extraordinary. The first goal was amazing, the right pass and tempo from Phil Foden. The biggest players appear on the biggest stages. It's the hour of truth. We started well. We have to do our job and finish it. I'm just really pleased for the result."" Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne spoke to TNT Sports after scoring and producing one assist: ""I'm just trying to play good. It's been a long five or six months but I'm just happy to be back, helping the team win games and be at my best. ""I feel alright. Obviously, I still need a couple more games and minutes. I've not played 90 minutes for almost a year but I'm getting there, I'm feeling good and the level is good enough for the moment - so I'm happy.""
