He was the fourth child of Tota and Chitori Maradona. A 3-year-old Diego received a football as a birthday present from a cousin, and it soon became his dear companion. Maradona displayed football talent at a very early age. At the age of eight, he joined Las Cebollitas (‚ÄúThe Little Onions""), a boys‚Äô team that went on to win 136 consecutive games and a national championship. Early yearsMaradona signed with Argentinos Juniors at age 14. He made his first-division debut in 1976. He was the youngest Argentine to make his debut with the national team.¬†    Maradona was excluded from the 1978 World Cup-winning squad because of his age. It was felt that he was still too young to play.¬†    Maradona, the midfielder, spent five years at the Argentinos Juniors, scoring 116 goals in 166 appearances. In 1979 he led the national under-20 team to a Junior World Cup championship.    In 1981, Maradona moved to Boca Juniors and, in the next year, he moved to Europe, playing with FC Barcelona for a record fee of $7.3 million. In June 1983, Maradona became the first Barcelona player to receive standing ovations from Real Madrid fans.    In 1984, Maradona was transferred to Napoli for another world record fee of $13 million. With Maradona the Napoli team won the league title and cup in 1987 and again the league title in 1990. Maradona‚Äôs stint with Napoli came to an end in 1991 when he was arrested in Argentina for cocaine possession and received a 15-month suspension from playing football. In 1995 he returned to Boca Juniors and played his last match on October 25, 1997.  1986-2011Maradona represented the Argentine national team in four World Cups:¬†1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994. He dominated the 1986 competition in Mexico. In a 2‚Äì1 quarterfinal victory over England, he scored two of the most memorable goals in the history of the World Cup.¬†    The first was scored with his hand (the referee mistakenly thought the ball had struck his head), a goal now remembered as the ‚ÄúHand of God"" goal. The second occurred after Maradona gained possession of the ball at midfield and dribbled through a pack of English defenders and past the keeper before depositing the ball in the goal.¬†    In 1990, he almost single-handedly took his team to the final but lost to Franz Beckenbauer's West Germany after Andreas Brehme scored from a penalty in the 85th minute.    He did not finish the 1994 World Cup because he tested positive for illegal drugs and was suspended.¬†    In 2008, Maradona was named the head coach of the Argentine national team and led the Argentina team to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup. Shortly after the 2010 World Cup, his tenure as the team‚Äôs head coach ended as he and Argentina‚Äòs football governing body could not agree on a contract extension.    In 2011, Maradona was hired to coach the United Arab Emirates club Al Waslb but was later fired.  Later lifeMaradona played 490 official club games during his 21-year professional career, scoring 259 goals. He played 91 games for Argentina and scored 34 goals.    He had health problems in his older days because of his alcohol dependency. On November 25, 2020, he suffered a heart attack and passed away at the age of 60.  Messi on MaradonaAfter winning the World Cup for Argentina in 2022, Lionel Messi wished Maradona was alive to see his country become world champions again.    ""I would have liked Diego to give me the cup, or at least to see all this, to see Argentina as world champions, with everything he wanted and how he loved the national team. I think from above, he ‚Äì like a lot of people who love me ‚Äì were strong,"" Messi said.

11,How Saudi clubs are disrupting European football,https://www.livemint.com/sports/football-news/how-saudi-clubs-are-disrupting-european-football-11694586928514.html,Author not found,"Updated: 13 Sep 2023, 12:13 PM IST","Although the NASL collapsed in 1984, the idea of raising the profile of a football league by signing older stars seeking a final payday (and a more relaxed level of competition) has been replicated elsewhere. Some of these leagues have flourished and gone on to develop local talent (Japan, Australia), whereas others have crashed and burned (China). The latest country to have a go is Saudi Arabia, whose revamped and highly lucrative Pro League is shaking up the economics of European football. In June the Saudi Arabian government announced that its sovereign wealth fund had acquired a 75% stake in four of the league‚Äôs 18 teams: Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr in Riyadh, and Al-Ahli and Al-Ittihad in Jeddah. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) is co-ordinating the acquisition of players based in Europe, of whom it aims to place at least three at each of these clubs. Four state-owned entities have invested in another four teams. The PIF argues that its involvement in football is part of a broader project to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil and to promote physical activity among citizens. In 2021 it bought an English Premier League club, Newcastle United, and Saudi Arabia is widely expected to bid to host the World Cup in 2030, perhaps as the dominant partner in a joint bid. Critics see the government‚Äôs investments in football, as well as in boxing, Formula One and golf, as an attempt to draw attention away from its dismal human-rights record. For wealthy European clubs, second-tier leagues in far-flung destinations have been relatively unimportant. They offer lucrative places to tour and suitable employers onto whom to offload fading stars on high-wage contracts. The transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo to Al-Nassr in late 2022 was greeted with a sigh of relief in the red half of Manchester. Chelsea have trimmed their bloated roster by selling three squad players to Saudi clubs. The wages on offer in the Middle East far exceed those on offer in the Premier League. Mr Ronaldo‚Äôs salary, including commercial agreements, is reportedly $200m per year. It appears, though, that the PIF‚Äôs ambitions extend further than taking Europe‚Äôs cast-offs. The most interesting signing so far this summer is that of a 26-year-old Portuguese midfielder, R√∫ben Neves. He moved from a mid-table Premier League team, Wolverhampton Wanderers, to Al-Hilal. Mr Neves, who was the club captain and has been a regular with the Portuguese national team, is entering his prime years. That he has opted to spend a chunk of these playing in a league of lower quality challenges the assumption of most clubs and fans that professionals will seek to play at the highest level they can. For Mr Neves, the transfer is a sacrifice of sorts. He is believed to earn much more money in Saudi Arabia, but his career at the highest level may have ended. Had he stayed in England, he could possibly have played for a club in the UEFA Champions League, Europe‚Äôs most prestigious competition. If he seeks a move back to Europe, clubs of the same calibre may not be interested in him. He could lose his place in the Portuguese team. The move also highlighted European clubs‚Äô vulnerabilities. Wolves are far from minnows. They are the world‚Äôs 25th-richest team by revenue, according to Deloitte, an accounting firm. Yet the PIF presented them with a clear choice. They could accept ¬£47m ($60m) for their star player or hold on to him for one more year until his contract expired, and then lose him for nothing. The number of clubs with either the status or resources to resist the PIF is very small. Consider also Marcelo Brozovic, a 30-year-old Croatian midfielder, who captained Internazionale in the Champions League final five weeks ago. After eight years in Milan he wanted a new challenge. Barcelona had been keen to sign him, but their contract offer was eclipsed by Al-Nassr‚Äôs, and Mr Brozovic chose to head east. It isn‚Äôt just that European clubs are struggling to keep hold of their existing players. Teams of all sizes‚Äîno one, after all, is more prestigious than Barcelona‚Äîmay have to rethink their recruitment plans. Players are still only trickling towards Saudi Arabia. But the summer transfer window does not close until the end of August, so for the next few weeks, and then again during transfer windows to come, European football clubs will look eastwards with concern. The PIF will continue to eye up well-known players‚Äîin particular if Saudi Arabia wins the right to part-host the World Cup in 2030, an outcome that would intensify the government‚Äôs focus on football. Much will be revealed in the next few years. Speculation abounds of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs lofty hopes: of entering its clubs in an expanded Champions League, or of reviving and expanding the reviled idea for a European Super League. For now, though, and for the first time, an upstart league is posing a genuine challenge to Europe‚Äôs stranglehold on the world‚Äôs brightest talents. ¬© 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

India have been seeking inspiration from their famous 0-0 draw against Qatar four years ago, however, could barely create scoring chances. The players did get a couple of opportunities at the fag end of the first half but wasted them. For the home team, the losing margin could have been more, had Qatar not missed several chances while dominating throughout the 90 minutes at the Kalinga Stadium. ALSO READ: Who is Wen Johnson, the Australian wearing 'Free Palestine' t-shirt who invaded pitch during World Cup final? The current head coach of the India national football team, Igor ≈†timac, is still hopeful to finish second in Group A and qualify for the third round for the first time following their 1-0 win over Kuwait in their away match on 16 November. Looking at the match, India's defense appeared weak from the very beginning after they conceded a goal in the 4th minute as Moustafa Tarek Mashal ensured the football hit the nets. Mashal sent a low right-footed shot that beat goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, who was fielded in place of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, all ends up. Akram Afif missed three chances which allowed India to go into the breather just one goal down. Qatar's prolific striker Almeoz Ali -- who scored four goals in a previous match against Afghanistan, nipped it in the bud by doubling the lead in the second minute of the second half, i.e. 47th minute. With just four minutes left from regulation time, Qatar made it 3-0 (86th minute) with Yusuf Adurisag heading home after connecting a cross from Mohammed Albayati. India is all set to play their 2026 World Cup qualifiers match against Afghanistan at the neutral venue of Tajikistan's Dushanbe on 21 March 2024. With agency inputs. Milestone Alert!

16,"Neymar to ‚Äòplay for Al-Hilal‚Äô in Saudi Arabia, deal underway for PSG transfer: Report",https://www.livemint.com/sports/football-news/neymar-to-play-for-al-hilal-in-saudi-arabia-deal-underway-for-psg-transfer-report-11691985683506.html,Sounak Mukhopadhyay,"Updated: 14 Aug 2023, 10:09 AM IST","Sources close to the Parisian club have revealed to Agence France-Presse (AFP) that Neymar, at 31 years old, is seemingly no longer a part of PSG's future plans. The Brazilian sensation, known for his dazzling skills on the field, has been swiftly linked to Al-Hilal in the Gulf region. ""Direct negotiations"" are underway between Neymar's agents and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), according to insiders who spoke to the agency. LiveMint could not independently verify the report. Also Read: Kylian Mbappe off to Al-Hilal? Saudi Arabian club makes record $332 million bid for PSG forward‚ÄúIf we reach an agreement with him in the coming hours, we would start negotiating with PSG immediately. He would play for Al-Hilal if a deal is sealed,"" AFP quoted the source as saying.    This potential move would mark a significant departure for Neymar, who made a record-breaking transfer of ‚Ç¨220 million (around  ‚Çπ1,800 crore) from Barcelona to PSG in 2017. Reports circulating in football circles speculate that Al-Hilal might present an offer in the ballpark of $80 million to secure the Brazilian's services.    Neymar's time at PSG has been marred by a series of injuries. Although he played a crucial role in propelling the club to the 2020 Champions League final, he has often found himself sidelined during pivotal matches.  Also Read: FIFA bans Cristiano Ronaldo's Saudi club Al-Nassr from registering new players over unpaid debtsIf this remarkable switch indeed takes place, Neymar will join the ranks of other football luminaries drawn to Saudi Arabia's lucrative football scene. Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al-Nassr earlier in 2023 set the precedent, and now Neymar could follow suit.    As the thrilling saga unfolds, Al-Hilal's potential coup of Neymar could further bolster their status as one of Saudi Arabia's premier clubs. With an illustrious history that includes four Asian Champions League victories, Al-Hilal is primed to make an indelible mark on the football landscape.    (With AFP inputs)

20,"Kiss controversy at Women‚Äôs World Cup: Spain‚Äôs football chief issues apology, ‚ÄòSurely I was wrong‚Äô",https://www.livemint.com/sports/football-news/kiss-controversy-at-women-s-world-cup-spain-s-football-chief-issues-apology-surely-i-was-wrong-11692667084019.html,Sounak Mukhopadhyay,"Updated: 22 Aug 2023, 07:18 AM IST","""Surely I was wrong, I have to admit,"" Reuters quoted Rubiales as saying in a video statement sent by the federation. ""It was without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness."" The incident took place as Rubiales presented gold medals to the Spanish team after their 1-0 victory over England in the final. He acknowledged his mistake in a video statement released by the federation, admitting that his actions were not with ill intent but rather occurred in the heat of the moment. Watch: Spanish football chief kisses player after Women‚Äôs World Cup win; Spain's star footballer 'didn't like it'However, Hermoso's reaction seemed to suggest discomfort. Video footage shared on social media platforms captured her remarking to teammates in the locker room that she ""didn't like it"". She later downplayed the incident, stating that it was a spontaneous and mutual gesture prompted by the overwhelming joy of winning a World Cup.    The incident has sparked discussions around consent and gender issues in Spain. The country's government has made significant legal reforms concerning gender change, abortion, and sex work. The incident has brought attention to the larger issue of non-consensual actions, with some considering such behaviour as a form of sexual violence that women experience daily.  Also Read: Spain clinches maiden FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 trophy, beats England 1-0Several government ministers, including Acting Second Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Diaz and Acting Culture and Sports Minister Miquel Iceta, criticised the incident, with Diaz calling for Rubiales' resignation due to the perceived attack on Hermoso. The acting Gender Equality Minister, Irene Montero, emphasised that non-consensual actions should not be normalised.    Despite the controversy, Hermoso has expressed her desire to focus on her achievement as a world champion, indicating her wish for the attention to shift away from the incident. Rubiales, who initially dismissed the outrage as the work of ""idiots"", later extended his apology also to those who had called him out for his actions.

31,Is there too much football?,https://www.livemint.com/sports/football-news/is-there-too-much-football-11698141195042.html,Author not found,"Updated: 24 Oct 2023, 04:40 PM IST","Mr Varane was speaking from experience. Since the start of the 2018-19 season, the Frenchman has been one of the most active footballers in Europe, featuring in more than 250 matches, according to FIFPRO, a group representing around 66,000 players from 66 countries. He made nearly 60% of these appearances within five days of a previous game, thereby getting less rest than FIFPRO recommends. His team-mate at United, Bruno Fernandes, has had it even worse. The Portuguese midfielder tops FIFPRO‚Äôs football-workload index. Last season he played 70 matches; FIFPRO‚Äôs medical experts recommend 55 at most. Such shifts are a recent phenomenon. At 23 years old, Vinicius Junior has played three times as many minutes for club and country (Real Madrid and Brazil) as Ronaldinho, a Brazilian star 20 years his senior, had at the same age. Jude Bellingham, England‚Äôs brightest young talent, played 30% more professional football before the age of 20 than did Wayne Rooney, who was a teenage star two decades ago. Some of the recent increase in workloads is due to the pandemic, which skewed schedules. But most of the additional burden is down to clubs (something to which Mr Varane‚Äôs complaint did not allude). It is they, after all, that decide who gets to play, and for how long. Pre-season weeks that are meant to be a time for preparation are increasingly seen as moneymaking opportunities. Clubs often embark on long, lucrative tours abroad that can drain players. Last season Mr Fernandes reported back for duty after just 22 days off (FIFPRO recommends a break of 28 days). FIFA, the game‚Äôs global governing body, has done little to help. Last year it scheduled the World Cup, the sport‚Äôs biggest tournament, in the middle of the football season in Europe, home to most top players. That gave players in national teams little time to recover. Eight days after playing in (and losing) the World Cup final, Mr Varane was once again lacing up his boots for Manchester United. Such schedules are taking their toll on many players, not just the stars. According to FIFPRO, 44% of footballers reported that they had experienced either extreme fatigue in the 2022-23 season, or more fatigue than in the previous season. Tired footballers are more likely to get hurt. Nearly two-thirds of the injuries reported in Europe‚Äôs five biggest leagues last season were to soft tissue‚Äîthe type associated with accumulated fatigue or insufficient recovery. According to a meta-study of men‚Äôs football published in 2022, fixture congestion also increases the risk of injuries. A FIFPRO survey in the same year revealed that 40% of footballers felt that a packed schedule was harming their mental health. Unhappy and unfocused players are rarely good ones. Many are retiring early from international football. Mr Varane, for instance, quit the French national team after the World Cup at the relatively early age of 29, citing his workload. Calling time gives him 30-50 extra days of rest a year. Things are likely to get worse. Referees are now required to lengthen games to make up for breaks in play. FIFPRO believes that, as a result, over a season some players could play the equivalent of three extra matches. Tournaments are also getting bigger. Next season the Champions League, Europe‚Äôs premier club tournament, will expand to 36 teams (from 32). The following season FIFA plans to launch a bloated Club World Cup with 32 teams. For some players that could lead to an increase of more than 10% on their current workload. Diogo Jota, a Portuguese forward, played 64 matches in the 2021-22 season, when his club, Liverpool, reached the Champions League final. A similarly successful season under the new formats would take his count to 72. Players in other sports have found ways to push back. In American football, they have negotiated an agreement with the National Football League that includes restrictions on workload, for example by limiting the amount of time spent training in pre-season. Similarly, Australian-rules football players have negotiated two compulsory rest days during every week of pre-season, and a day per week during the season. Football seems a long way from such measures. With so many domestic leagues competing for players and audiences, the sport suffers from a collective-action problem. More money than ever is pouring into the game, from media companies, private-equity investors and now, increasingly, sovereign-wealth funds. That makes it harder to reduce the number of matches. A lot of that money goes to the players, many of whom will prefer cash to a lighter workload. Tired though they are, they will carry on playing. ¬© 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

The decision signifies a notable shift in Neymar's trajectory, as he embarked on a groundbreaking transfer worth ‚Ç¨220 million (approximately  ‚Çπ1,800 crore) from Barcelona to PSG in 2017. Neymar is one of the most loved football players as he showcased some exceptional football, but his journey is interrupted by multiple injuries and continuous off-field distractions. His departure is in line with PSG's plan to retain younger players. Notably, around fifty percent of the team now boasts an average age below 23, indicative of their emphasis on youthful development. PSG's aim encompasses nurturing talent rather than exclusively pursuing established luminaries. Neymar will still be remembered as PSG's top players with some great performances like during the 2020 Champions League when he propelled the football club to finals. Al Hilal's attempts at big playersAl Hilal has attempted to get some crucial players this season and also approached legends like Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. While Messi chose to go with Inter Miami, Mbappe expressed confusion but finally decided to stay with PSG.    With an impressive track record of four Asian Champions League triumphs, Al-Hilal's storied history positions them to leave an indelible imprint on the football world.

The legend was well-known for his ability to read the game and contribute both defensively and offensively. Der Kaiser's influence extended beyond the field, making him one of the most respected figures in the history of football. He was one of few footballers to win the FIFA World Cup as a player in 1974 when he led West Germany to the cup, and then as a manager in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Accumulating a total of 103 international appearances for West Germany, he secured victory in the 1972 European Championship and later triumphed in the World Cup hosted in his home country, a significant achievement following the disappointment of losing in the final to England in 1966. Club career with Franz BeckenbauerFranz Beckenbauer spent the majority of his club career with Bayern Munich and won numerous domestic and international titles, including multiple Bundesliga championships and European Cup/Champions League titles.    Bayern Munich squad led by him stood out as the premier club team globally in the mid-1970s, clinching three consecutive European Cups and Bundesliga titles. Additionally, Beckenbauer, in recognition of his outstanding contributions, earned the prestigious title of European Footballer of the Year on two occasions.    Beyond achieving success in football, Franz Beckenbauer has actively participated in diverse administrative capacities within the sport, playing a key role in the planning and execution of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that my information is only current up to January 2022, and there might have been further developments in Franz Beckenbauer's life or career since that time.    ¬†    ¬†

Additionally, another resident, a barber, experienced a positive turn of fortune after encountering Messi. Meanwhile, a muralist who travels the world found inspiration in Messi's World Cup triumph, leading to the creation of a widely acclaimed piece of art, the report added. Messi's July visit to Prima Pasta captured global attention with patrons making an effort to maintain a sense of normalcy as Messi and his family dined nearby.‚ÄúMessi casually walked in through the front door,"" Angelo Acci√≥n, 30, a bartender who was working that night told The Athletic. ‚ÄúAt first the customers who were here didn‚Äôt realize that he had walked in.

Having developed a friendship with the Messi family, Cea also owns a Gibson guitar signed by Inter Miami's No. 10, the report noted. ‚ÄúLeo is always super cool,"" Cea told The Athletic, adding, ‚ÄúThis was his third visit but his family has been coming for the last 12 years. He‚Äôs always so relaxed, always smiling. Never a problem. Just a very cool person."" Cea noted that the agnolotti Rosso is Messi‚Äôs favourite dish, a stuffed pasta with ricotta cheese and spinach in pink sauce.

His life took a turn last summer when he became Messi's personal barber.    Rivera's Destiny Barber Studio, situated in Wynwood, boasts a sleek and contemporary design, featuring three black leather barber chairs and a meticulously selected playlist of salsa music to enhance the ambiance.

A native of the coastal city of Patillas in southeast Puerto Rico, Rivera, aged 29, hails from a beach town that stands in the city of San Juan.    ‚ÄúMiami is my life, bro,"" says Rivera. ‚ÄúI came here with a humble mindset but with big plans. Miami shows you that anything is possible in life. There are no limits in Miami. I didn‚Äôt know any of my famous customers when I came here. I found them here.

I had pitched a different design but we went with this one. It was about welcoming Messi and visualizing him with Inter Miami. It‚Äôs Messi as a world champion. That‚Äôs the Messi that we have now and the Messi that everyone loves.""    Messi sightings are becoming increasingly common in Miami, whether he's spotted at a local coffee shop, sipping mat√©, or attending a birthday celebration for a friend of his eldest son Thiago, who is a member of Inter Miami's U-12 academy team.    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so impressive,"" Miculitzki said, adding, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lived here now for more than 20 years. We know what Leo means and how he moves people ‚Äî football fans and otherwise. That‚Äôs been proven. Messi‚Äôs reach is worldwide. It‚Äôs incredible. You have to live it to really understand it.""
