""I think you don’t see it the same way as if you probably were winning every time, every game. But now the results are coming.""The work that we’ve been doing in the past, I think it’s starting now to pay off. ""We’re starting to get our rewards from it in the second part of the season.

The post, with 87,000 likes and 108,000 followers, had the caption, ""The Ballon d'Or hits different when it's earned."" This follows Ronaldo's questioning the credibility of individual awards, especially after Lionel Messi's recent win for Best FIFA Men's player.""I think that, in a way, these awards are losing credibility. We have to analyse the entire season. It's not to say that Messi didn't deserve it, or Haaland or even Mbappe.

Martin Odegaard's 'secret signal' helped Arsenal score highest goals from corners in Premier League,https://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-01-21-martin-odegaards-secret-signal-helped-arsenal-score-highest-goals-from-corners-in-premier/,Meghna @ 1819,BBC via Give Me Sport,2024-01-21T17:36:23.000Z,"Arsenal pulled off two incredible goals from as many corners in our 5-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace this weekend. Gabriel Magalhaes was the man of the moment after scoring both goals but, unfortunately, the second one was listed as an own goal to Palace. On both occasions, Martin Odegaard was spotted doing something with his socks. That's according to BBC Match of the Day pundit, former Wales and Swansea defender Ashley Williams. Williams noted Odegaard tampering with his socks before both corners as a possible signal to the taker on where to hit the corner. Quoted by Give Me Sport, Williams said: ""There’s always a trigger for what the [corner's] movement’s going to be, and we can see they have worked on whether it’s a front-post corner or a back-post corner.""If you keep an eye on Odegaard, we feel - maybe we’ve had too much time on our hands - but we feel that maybe he’s signalling something to the corner taker.""He’s in the same place for every corner and he’s playing with his socks. The reason we’re looking for a trigger is because [these things] are worked on.""There is synchronicity regarded whether they go to the front or the back. Every clip we see here he is doing the same thing where he’s playing with his socks."" Sock tampering or not, the Arsenal captain's methods appear to be working. No other Premier League side has scored more goals than Arsenal from set-pieces this season. Excluding penalties, the Gunners have bagged 13 points from set-pieces. That's the highest in the league so far, with Manchester City only managing nine from corners. 'Not on the level expected': William Gallas blames Odegaard for Arsenal's struggles"
"Ruben Amorim at Chelsea: tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-14-ruben-amorim-at-chelsea-tactical-profile-biggest-strengths-and-possible-xis/,Michael Ellis,Tribuna.com,2024-02-14T17:58:00.000Z,"Mauricio Pochettino has seemingly bought himself some time in charge of Chelsea after overseeing two 3-1 wins over Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, but it would be wrong to assume his job is completely safe.The new Chelsea ownership group showed that they can act under the pressure of displeased fans. That's what brought Graham Potter down less than a year ago.One of the coaches Chelsea reportedly interviewed to succeed Potter was Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim. He did not get the job, but his body of work since then suggests that he should be back in the frame should Pochettino get the sack.Since taking over at Sporting four years ago, Amorim led the club to their first league trophy in 19 years, while also grabbing a couple of Portuguese League Cups. This season, his side is toe-to-toe with Benfica for another Liga Portugal title.Tactical style and strengthsThink of Amorim as a modern version of Antonio Conte, albeit not as combustible on the touchline.The constant feature of his team is a back three. However, the central defender is not used as a last man but as someone who can move forward and join the double pivot in the buildup. That would not be good news for Thiago Silva even if he stayed beyond this season.The wing-backs are attack-minded, holding the width in possession, while the front three are narrow and fluid, with players constantly rotating and overloading inside channels.Out of possession, Amorim's team can be flexible. They prefer to press high, with all three forwards and at least one wing-back involved. They can also drop low in a 5-2-3 shape. In both cases, the aim is to close the central lines, force the attacking team to the flank and narrow the space and passing lanes for the player on the ball.Potential weaknessRuben Amorim is a coach who rightly excites top European clubs. The question mark about him is whether he can make his system work as efficiently outside of the Portuguese league.As a head coach, Amorim has not worked outside Portugal. Even as a player, he did not play in another European country, with his only stint abroad being a season at Al-Wakrah in Qatar.In recent history, Chelsea hired two coaches who had never managed outside Portugal. One, Jose Mourinho, worked out fine; the other, Andre Villas-Boas, not so much. But they had experiences abroad, even if not as head coaches. So, hiring Amorim would represent a risk, regardless of his qualities.Lineup 1Let's imagine how the current Chelsea squad would fit in under Amorim if he took over now.We're also bearing in mind the current injury problems, which is why Reece James is not in our XI. Malo Gusto seems to be fitting in just as well, though.The biggest question seems to be up front. Nicolas Jackson has yet to convince he deserves to start regularly for Chelsea with all players fit. Perhaps, the solution would be to move Conor Gallagher forward, since there would be one midfield slot less under Amorim.Lineup 2Now, imagine if Amorim arrives at Stamford Bridge in the summer. He would not be given endless transfer funds, but some areas would need to be strengthened, particularly at centre-back and centre-forward.It is possible that James could move to a familiar and less physically demanding role in the back three which would also help keep Gusto in.Up front, though, a transfer is all but inevitable, and Chelsea have been linked with a centre-forward who just happens to thrive under Amorim at Sporting (16 goals and eight assists in 19 league games at the time of writing). His name is Viktor Gyokeres, he's familiar with English football, having spent three years in the Championship, and this season, he compares favourably even with Victor Osimhen.Hansi Flick at Chelsea: Tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIsRoberto de Zerbi at Chelsea: Tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs"

On the contrary, the manager and the official have enjoyed a great relationship ever since.Jose Mourinho and Mark HalseyWhen Halsey was diagnosed with cancer, Jose immediately gave him a helping hand.""Jose was in charge of Inter Milan and then Real Madrid at the time, so quite often he'd invite me and my mate out to Madrid to come and watch their games,"" Halsey said in 2022, as cited by the Daily Star.""He'd bring us up to meet the players and have dinner with the team - me and my mate Pete. Jose made sure we got looked after while we were over there.""When I was battling cancer, the whole footballing world was good to me, but Jose in particular was incredible. I put on a charity dinner at Old Trafford, the cricket ground, and Jose sent a video over for us to play on the night.""He took time out of his plans to put together a video, where he spoke about how he liked the way I refereed, he said I was like the 23rd player on the pitch because he could tell I loved the game and showed empathy for players and that I was very, very fair.""Mourinho's support helped Halsey win the fight: today, at 62 years old, the former referee is going strong and is a sometimes comes to Santiago Bernabeu.

The Blaugrana will find it difficult to register the player in the summer if they don't lighten their wage bill by offloading some players.

However, the plan is not to permanently offload all three players just to get Garcia.

In what comes as welcome news for fans, the incoming CEO understands that Man United are at risk of breaching the upper limits of Financial Fair Play restrictions. That's mostly down to spending unexplainable amounts on players who don't deserve it and then handing them exorbitant weekly wages. Sources have indicated to Give Me Sport that Berrada will 'shock' fans with his pragmatic approach to transfers once he assumes charge in the summer. For the Red Devils to balance the books, there will reportedly be a huge focus on clearing out the squad.

What formation Napoleon would use if he were a football coach and what French players he'd pick,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-17-what-formation-would-napoleon-use-if-he-were-a-football-coach-and-what-french-players-wou/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-01-17T17:16:00.000Z,"Napoleon Bonaparte was one of the greatest conquerors in history. A detailed mathematical analysis proves he is actually the greatest general in history of warfare, beating the second-highest performer, Julius Caesar, by a huge margin – 16.679 WAR (Wins Above Replacement – an estimate of a general's performance in war compared to other top generals) against 7.445.The unique set of skills he possessed at the time could’ve also made him the GOAT among modern football managers. As a smart and innovative tactician, the French leader didn’t mind replacing seasoned generals with younger ones to keep his strategies fresh. Despite surviving on a mere 3-4 hours of sleep per day, he relentlessly improved his abilities through hard work. Beyond his military prowess, Napoleon's greatness lay in his profound connection with simple soldiers as he earned their genuine affection through his exceptional man-management skills.Who would make Napoleon's roster?Mostly loyal, hardworking players who are also pacy, mobile and creative enough.Mike Maignan. Faithful, consistent – the Milan goalkeeper would be France’s first choice no matter who the head coach is. We may compare him to Napoleon’s cavalry officer Joachim Murat, a key figure in Bonaparte’s inner circle whose leadership was crucial in multiple battles, especially in the Jena-Austerstedt one against the Prussian forces.Jules Kounde. His mobility is truly impressive. Like marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet, Kounde has mostly succeeded on Spanish battlefields. Moreover, Suchet’s most notable campaign occurred in Catalonia where he displayed exceptional defensive and organisational skills.William Saliba. The centre-back is a real fighter who knows how to clean up his teammates’ mistakes in the rear. As the standout defender, he could be compared to general Auguste de Marmont who demonstrated outstanding defensive skills during the Peninsular War and in various battles against the British.Dayot Upamecano. The Bayern centre-back is one of the most powerful and hardworking players in the roster. His aggressiveness reminds us of another of Napoleon’s marshals, Pierre Augereau, who led the French forces in a fierce way against the Austrian army at the Battle of Castiglione.Theo Hernandez. The left-back would have a special role on Napoleon’s team as the most damaging attacks would be launched exactly from his wing. His fearlessness and audacity would make him as important as marshal Jean Lannes was for Bonaparte – his bold and effective attacks helped turn things around in the Battle of Marengo against the Austrians.Eduardo Camavinga. The midfielder has made his fans create songs about him – almost as if he were some legendary soldier of the past. Cama is a versatile warrior who can occupy almost every position in midfield in defence. Eduardo’s historical ‘twin’ is Nicolas Soult who rapidly rose through the ranks at a young age and demonstrated top ability in both defence and offence.Aurelien Tchouameni. The defensive midfielder will make sure Bonaparte’s winning record is perfect – Real Madrid are yet to lose a single game with him on the pitch this season. We would compare him to Andre Massena, one of Napoleon’s most successful comrades, also called the ‘Dear Child of Victory’.Kingsley Coman. It’s not just the pace that makes Coman special – he is also clutch in big games, including Champions League finals. Besides, few players can boast about having won 29 trophies at just 27 years old. His historical prototype can be Louis-Alexandre Berthier who broke into the French army as a youngster and played a big role in campaigns all over the world.Antoine Griezmann. One of the most loyal players in the history of the national team. A symbol of Les Bleus who has hit his prime again. Griezmann is the analogue of Napoleon’s ‘Iron Marshal’ Louis-Nicolas Davout, mostly known for his tactical brilliance and exceptional intelligence that was at its best at the Battle of Austerlitz.Kylian Mbappe. Although the French superstar is not an easy player to deal with, he remains the team’s most powerful force for years to come. His effectiveness and courage make us feel he is Michel Ney – Napoleon’s legendary comrade who led his army from the front lines, particularly in the Peninsular War against the Spanish and Portuguese where he earned the ‘Bravest of the Brave’ nickname.Olivier Giroud. The 36-year-old is definitely not among the fastest France players, but his work rate and physical ability make him a standout performer too. As a recent Serie A winner who keeps playing a key role at 37, he could be compared to Eugene de Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy who was quite effective in some of the biggest engagements of the Napoleonic Wars including the Battle of Wagram.What formation would he choose?To identify Napoleon’s game plan, let’s use the famous Battle of Austerlitz as an example – the engagement that took place between the French army and the Russian and Austrian forces in 1805, ending in the latter’s decisive defeat and the collapse of the Third Coalition which was chiefly made up of Britain, Austria and Russia.It’s arguably as iconic as the 1998 World Cup final between France and Brazil. Just like in that game, where France played with 10 men for half an hour, Bonaparte’s troops were outnumbered – some 72,000 men against 85,000 opposition soldiers.Here is a brief description of what was happening on the battlefield back then:Based on Napoleon’s deployment of troops during the Austerlitz, we believe he would pick the 4-2-1-3 formation for his team. It would be quite asymmetric, though, as his greatest tactical trick would be deceiving the opposition by deliberately weakening the right side, just like in the famous battle:With the opposition mostly deploying their forces on France’s right flank, Napoleon would take advantage of the gap in the opponent’s middle area and attack the space:After the midfield battle is won and the opposition are spread to the left and the right, Napoleon would proceed by attacking the opponent’s vulnerable wings – mostly through his left which is still fresh as it wasn’t quite involved yet.Although Kylian Mbappe is usually used as a striker in the national team, here he would be deployed on the left wing to use his pace to the fullest. Call it one more major tactical tweak of Bonaparte to make his left wing absolutely destructive:After the opposition is exhausted, Napoleon would make sure the battle is won by using his reserves. Explosive forwards like Randal Kolo Muani, Moussa Diaby and Christopher Nkunku could add some freshness to the attack in the second half:Napoleon Bonaparte would’ve really taken the world of football by storm – and his non-stop tactical creativity would also make him fun to watch.We can only wonder what bets people would have made on that battle back in the day if they had had such an opportunity. One-day win, draw or 'Napoleon to destroy Third Coalition before the new year'?"

Real Madrid's ultimate XI to beat Atletico – Rodrygo benched,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-04-real-madrids-ultimate-xi-to-beat-atletico-rodrygo-benched/,Nаdine,Tribuna.com,2024-02-04T15:19:00.000Z,"In just five hours, Real Madrid will lock horns with Atletico in what will be their fourth head-to-head encounter this season.With two games in Diego Simeone's favour, Carlo Ancelotti will be looking to even the score tonight. For this to happen, the Italian boss has to deploy his best lineup possible. There's four key players missing from the squad at the moment, so that won't be an easy task to complete. Yet, Los Blancos boast a roster filled with versatile players who can competently fill their shoes. Here how our starting XI for the game could look like:Yes, we've opted to bench Rodrygo for Joselu, and we've got a solid reason for it. Standing tall at 1.92m, the striker brings crucial air presence and a threat in the box. His ability to score headers out of nowhere could be our x-factor against a defensively strong side like Atleti.As for Antonio Rudiger, despite initially being a doubt for the game, the German successfully completed a fitness test earlier today and is likely to secure his starting spot. Having our reliable center-back in the starting lineup would undoubtedly boost confidence in our defense.❓ What do you guys think?"

My dream has always been to play in Europe. I tried to let Boca have sell-on clause but no way… so Brighton had to trigger the clause.""Barco caught Brighton's attention with his breakthrough in senior football, showcasing versatility as a full-back and winger. This signing aligns with Brighton's successful track record of nurturing top talent from South America, evident in the moves of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo to Liverpool and Chelsea last summer.The Argentine prodigy Barco is now set to fight for a spot in Roberto De Zerbi's team, who have brought in young talent such as Ansu Fati this season."
How much money did Barca miss out on following elimination from Copa del Rey?,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-25-how-much-money-did-barca-miss-out-on-following-elimination-from-copa-del-rey/,Kingsley_,Forbes,2024-01-25T09:43:10.000Z,"Barcelona last won the Copa Del Rey in 2021. Back then they had Lionel Messi helping them achieve it. The Blaugrana earned around €3m for lifting the trophy that year, including TV revenue. Fast forward to 2024, Messi is long gone and Barca can't get past the quarter-final stage of the Copa Del Rey. This season, the winners of the Copa del Rey will smile to the bank with a fixed prize money of €1.2m. When TV revenue is factored in, the champions could go home with around €5 million in winnings. Usually, the Copa del Rey prize money depends on the competition's TV revenue for the year. Although it's nowhere near La Liga, winning the competition comes with a handsome financial reward exceeding €5 million for top clubs like Barca who attract larger TV audiences. The Blaugrana could do with every penny. Barca earned around €400,000 for reaching the quarter-final of the Copa Del Rey this year, but that's barely enough to cover Frenkie De Jong's two weeks salary. Besides the prize money from the Copa Del Rey, Barca are also at risk of missing out of the Spanish Super Cup next January. Appearing in the competition this year fetched Barca €6 million in revenue. Barca's route to the Super Cup now lies in winning La Liga or at least finishing second like they did two seasons ago. Xavi: 'We have competed very well. We can be proud'"

The 27-year-old Brazilian, who has found success as a midfielder under Eddie Howe, suffered a thigh injury in the Magpies' recent FA Cup victory over Sunderland. With surgery scheduled for next week, it's unlikely Joelinton will feature again this season.Reports suggest that Joelinton's current wage demands exceed what Newcastle are willing to pay, leading to speculation that he might be sold before making another appearance. The Mail outlines that, with only 18 months left on his current deal, a compromise needs to be reached for Joelinton's long-term future at the club.It would be tough for Howe to lose the midfielder, as he really wants to keep Joelinton.

If Mbappe leaves PSG in June he will do so as a free agent with Real Madrid not obligated to pay any transfer fee. Still, the sign-on bonus will be the biggest ever paid for a player arriving on a free transfer in football history if Florentino Perez agrees to it. Mbappe's salary demands are also acrimonious when compared to what other Real Madrid players currently earn. Madrid's top earner Toni Kroos bags less than €15m net per season. Mbappe is demanding nearly three times that, which isn't up to his current salary at PSG. Real Madrid probably understands that the 25-year-old will cost them an arm and a leg even if they're getting him as a free agent. Thus, the economic conditions of the deal will be studied carefully before the green button is pressed. Mbappe is one of the most prolific forwards in Europe having scored over 318 goals in his career so far. 'I went from stars to the bottom': Mbappe recalls 2013 Real Madrid visit"

With his set-piece quality, ball retention ability and passing traits, he can definitely help the Red Devils control games better. With that being said, here are two ways Man United can line up with him next season.Option 1: In midfield with MainooKimmich can slot into Man United’s midfield shape nicely and also be the ideal partner for the blossoming Kobbie Mainoo. As he likes to play a more deeper role, the German midfielder can allow Mainoo to wander forward in attempts to create moves and score goals. Joshua and Mainoo’s energy and defensive qualities mean that Bruno Fernandes can also probably play a more attacking role going forward.Option 2: Emergancy right-back optionEven though he’s now a full-fledged midfielder, Kimmich is a really versatile player who has played as a right-back in the past for Bayern Munich. That means he can be a cover option in that area too for Man United, potentially allowing the club to play the Casemiro-Mainoo connection. Kimmich boasts a decent crossing ability, so he can overlap from the right and create chances with his delivery too."

Real Madrid are only confident of signing Mbappe but they were just as confident in 2022 when the player made a shocking U-turn to extend his contract with PSG for two more years.

According to reports, the French Ligue 1 will miss out on close to €100m in advertising and merchandise revenue if Mbappe leaves Paris. While Real Madrid must be prepared to pay a huge sign-on bonus if Mbappe is to join them, Spanish sources say Los Blancos are unwilling to offer him the same salary they did in 2022.

LaLiga conducted an internal investigation after the incident first came to light during Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Getafe last week. After an on-field tackle went wrong, Bellingham appeared to mouth the word 'rapist' at Greenwood. The Manchester United loanee was charged with rape and assault of his partner but the victim then dropped the charges. The case never proceeded beyond that and Man United refused to let him back. Although Greenwood has impressed on loan at Getafe, it's unlikely he will ever play for Man United again. As for Bellingham, a former Man United target, lip-readers have agreed he used that word. If found guilty, Bellingham will be up for punishment by the Spanish FA as well as LaLiga."

There might be more players than you think. Here, you can get to know them and their careers a bit better.  Norway is known in the football world to have produced many great players through time. There’s one player that probably comes to mind when you think about Norwegian football at the moment. But there are actually a lot more great Norwegian players than just the one superstar. Several Norwegian football stars are among the most searched athletes. Some of the most searched athletes and footballers, in particular, are also some of the most popular profiles among fans.  Many fans like to follow the careers and successes of these amazing players. At the absolute top, you will obviously find the Norwegian superstar Erling Haaland, but also other significant Norwegian athletes like the golf player Viktor Hovland and tennis player Casper Ruud. If you’re mostly interested in football, the good news is that there are plenty of great Norwegian football players that you can get to know and support. If you don’t know them already, you can learn more about some of the best, most talented Norwegian footballers at the moment right here. Erling Haaland The biggest star of Norwegian football is, of course, the already legendary Erling Haaland. The 23-year-old player currently plays in the Premier League for Manchester City. He is considered to be one of the best players in the world and is one of the most valuable players at Manchester City. He broke the record for most scored goals in one season in his first season in the Premier League. He started his career in Molde, then Salzburg moved on to Borussia Dortmund and then Manchester City in 2022. He has already broken several records and was impressively a runner-up for this year's Ballon d’Or. There’s no doubt that this Norwegian player is the creme de la creme of Norwegian football and will continue on to have a long and impressive career that will make history.  Martin Ødegaard Another impressive Norwegian player is the 25-year-old Martin Ødegaard. He has played for the Spanish club Real Madrid before moving on to the English club Arsenal, where is currently captain of the team. Arsenal signed him for no less than €35 million. He broke several records for being the youngest player to play for the Norwegian national team, where he is now also captain. Martin Ødegaard has already made an impressive career for himself and still has many years ahead of him. Since 2014, he has played 30 games for Norway’s senior national team.  Alexander Sørloth Alexander Sørloth is another Norwegian player who has certainly made a name for himself on the international football scene. He is currently on loan from RP Leipzig to Real Sociedad in Spain. He is the son of another well-known Norwegian former footballer, Goran Sørloth. He is an incredibly fast player who is also great at scoring goals. This has earned him several trophies and honors. He has been on the Norwegian national team since 2016, where he has played 32 games and scored a total of 11 goals.  Kristofer Ajer A name that is very broadly known in the football world is Kristofer Ajer. The 25-year-old player is currently playing for Brentford in the Premier League. He is a player known to be flexible and able to play as a midfielder and defender. He has done quite well in both positions. He is also a part of the national team, where he is a solid part of the team. He has been a part of the Norwegian senior national team since 2018 where he has played 23 games in total. When he was young and played in the best Norwegian league, he broke a record by becoming the youngest captain in the league’s history. He was close to turning 17 when he impressively made captain.  Sander Berge Another Norwegian player in the Premier League is Sander Berger, who was also born in 1998. He currently plays defensive midfielder for Burnley, where he has been since 2023. Berge was signed in 2023 by the English club Sheffield United as their most expensive player, which proved to be a good investment before moving on to Burnley. He made his debut for the Norwegian senior national team in 2017 and, since then, has appeared in 42 games for Norway. Mohamed Elyounoussi Mohamed Elyounoussi is also known as Moi and is another of the best Norwegian players who have played in the Premier League. He has previously played for Southampton and Celtic on loan. Currently, he is playing for the Danish team F. C. København in Copenhagen. He began playing for the Norwegian senior national team in 2014 where he played in 54 games and scored 10 goals. He even scored a hat-trick for Norway in 2017, where they played against San Marino.  Leo Skiri Østigård  The 24-year-old Leo Skiri Østigård is another Norwegian player who has made a name for himself. He is currently playing in Seria A for the Italian team Napoli, where he plays as a centre-back. He started his senior career in Molde and soon moved on to Brighton. During his time in Brighton (2018-2022), he was on loan to several clubs, such as Stoke City and Genoa. In 2022, he transferred to Napoli, where he has played 19 games so far. He also plays for the Norwegian national team, where he has been playing for the senior team since 2022. This was the same year he scored a goal in his first-ever Champions League match.  Marcus Holmgren Pedersen On this list is also the 23-year-old Marcus Holmgren Pedersen. This young Norwegian is currently on loan from Feyenoord to Sassuolo. He has played 17 games for the Italian team where he has been on loan since 2023. He started his youth career in HIF/Stein and moved on to Tromsø to pursue a football career. He also played for Tromsø in his senior career before moving on to Molde and then later Feyenoord. He is also a part of the Norwegian national team where he has played 20 matches since his senior debut in 2021. The loan agreement with the Italian club Sassuolo has an option to buy, so it’ll be interesting to see whether the young player will be moving to Italy on a more permanent basis.  The future of Norwegian football As you can tell, there is a lot of Norwegian football talent on the international football scene. This is just a selection of some of the most known and successful players at the moment. All these players are still young and shaping their careers as they’re moving forward. There is no doubt that they will continue making a Norwegian impact on the international football scene and on the Norwegian national football team. They will be some of the players who will continue on to become an important part of the history books and of Norway's contribution to the amazing sport of football."

Alves is undergoing trial in court in Barcelona after being incarcerated for nearly a year over the incident. The Brazilian was remanded in prison after a judge denied him bail while the investigation remained ongoing. The iconic defender has not been spotted in public since 2023 following his arrest and subsequent imprisonment in Barcelona, a city where he played football, won everything and attained legendary status. Here are the first pics of Alves looking humbled as he sits in court awaiting his trial:Reports say Alves is set to testify that he had consensual sex with the then 23-year-old woman.

4 young players have had their loans cut short in January — Chelsea's loans used to be much better,https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-22-4-young-players-have-had-their-loans-cut-short-in-january-chelseas-loans-used-to-be-much/,Aleksei Blokhin,,2024-01-22T19:09:59.000Z,"Andrey Santos, Diego Moreira, David Datro Fofana and Cesare Casadei have had their loans cut short.Of these four players, only the Italian had a successful loan, making 24 appearances for Leicester. He was brought back to the Bridge to fight for a place in the first team.The other three's experiences away on loan ranged from disappointing to disastrous. Datro Fofana scored mighty two goals in 12 appearances for Union Berlin, Moreira failed to register any goal contributions in just nine games with Lyon and Santos played just two matches for Forest.But poor loans haven't always been the case.Mason Mount's two loans, first with Vitesse and then with Derby, made him ready for first-team football with Chelsea. Conor Gallagher spent a season on loan with Palace, earned an England call-up and firmly established himself as one of the best midfielders in the league. Tammy Abraham spent the 2018/19 season with Aston Villa in the Championship, netting 25 goals in 37 league appearances and showing that he's a Premier League-level player. Ruben Loftus-Cheek struggled with injuries and couldn't break into Chelsea's first-team squad, so he left the club for Fulham in 2020. He put his career back on track during his season at Craven Cottage.Fikayo Tomori, who was a rotation player at best at the Bridge, impressed on a 2021 loan to AC Milan, leading the Italian club to spend £25m on the defender. Ethan Ampadu went on three successive – and successful – loans between 2020 and 2023, earning a £7m move to Leeds last summer.So Chelsea have shown in the past they can make good decisions over loan destinations for their youngsters. Unfortunately, this season it doesn't appear to be the case so far."

Deco is personally interested in inviting the Portuguese to the club: the 49-year-old is set to leave Porto at the end of the season and Blaugrana’s sporting director knows him well.The former Portugal international has done a decent job at the helm of Porto. Let’s see what he can offer us.***Conceicao is renowned for his teams’ intense, high-tempo, aggressive style of play. His players aim to regain possession quickly and go forward using all their width in a 4-4-2 formation that turns into 4-2-4 in the offensive phase. In defence, he mostly relies on players in the middle of the park, using two energetic midfielders (one of those is ex-La Masia prospect Nico) and two rock-solid centre-backs.Porto’s biggest strength under Conceicao is exactly the way they attack down the wings: full-backs actively support wingers who cut inside while one of the two strikers drops back. You may spot multiple wingers and full-backs among Porto’s players with the most goal contributions this season.In recent head-to-head clashes, Barca players struggled to properly mark Porto’s opposition attackers, allowing multiple big chances despite dominating the game in possession.Expectedly, Porto’s biggest weakness is defending the wings: Conceicao’s first-choice wing-backs, Wendell and Joao Mario, are usually pretty much involved in the attack and it’s difficult to cover for them all the time. The Portuguese specialist probably dreams of working with Joao Cancelo who is arguably the most complete wing-back one may find.Let’s think about two line-ups Conceicao might use at Barcelona:Lineup 1Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Yamal, De Jong, Gavi, Raphinha; Lewandowski, Felix.Looks like a great option if Barca make no big summer signings. Two attack-minded wing-backs, the centre-back partnership that looked fantastic against Porto in the Champions League, dynamic and energetic midfield and the four-man attack full of players Conceicao would love to work with (he actually coached Raphinha for some time back in the day).Lineup 2Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Raphinha, Gavi, Pedri, Pepê; Lewandowski, Felix.If there’s one player Conceicao would probably want to take to Barca, it’s Pepê (not the Real Madrid bully), especially given Blaugrana’s plan to sign a left winger. The 26-year-old leads the way with the most assists for Porto this season – just like last term when he finished the campaign with 10.Is Sergio Conceicao your preferred candidate to take over at Barca?

Unfortunately, his fine performance was cut short by an ankle injury. Hopefully, that's not too serious.Camavinga - 8.5 The Frenchman was superb in midfield today for Real Madrid. It was his pass that started Madrid's scoring spree with Vinicius taking advantage. Camavinga was a calming influence in that midfield, winning tackles breaking the play and creating some chances. What a player!Tchouameni - 8 We have to give Tchouameni his flowers today. The Frenchman played out of his natural position as Ancelotti deployed him at centreback and he did so well helping Los Blancos keep a clean sheet. What more can we say?

It's not that he had a quiet game either. Garnacho was able to repeatedly get into the final third, but his final product was poor.The winger especially frustrated Rasmus Hojlund with his underwhelming decision-making and left the forward fuming on a few occasions.The first occasion took place around the 20th-minute mark when Garnacho went through into the box. Hojlund was standing all alone in the far post, but rather than pass it to him, the winger took a shot that rattled the post.Garnacho tested the Danish forward's patience again later in the first half, after bursting into the Newport area on a counter-attack.However, he failed to spot Hojlund ready to score a tap-in in the middle and tried to set up Antony outside the box, who missed. Rasmus was later seen with his hands up in the air in frustration and complaining to his teammate. Alejandro had another chance to set things up for Hojlund in the 64th minute after the forward played him through the left. But Garnacho ended up sending in another poor cross that went way past the striker, right to the other wing itself. Hojlund could not believe his luck and kicked the post in frustration after being denied another potential scoring opportunity. Fortunately, Rasmus did get his goal late into the game - but if Garnacho's decision-making had been better, he could've had more.The young winger has only produced two assists in 29 appearances this season and really needs to improve his awareness in the final third to set up more goals.'Well done boys': Ten Hag reacts to nervy Newport County winAntony – 7, Bayindir – 6: rating Man United players in Newport CountNewport County AFC – Manchester United 2:4 (1:2, 1:2)28 January, 16:30, Rodney ParadeStatisticsLineupsTableAll matchesNewport County AFC: Townsend, Lewis (Payne 70), McLoughlin, Delaney, Bennett (Baker 79), Clarke, Wildig ( 78), Charsley (Waite 78), Morris, Palmer-Houlden (Wood 90+7), EvansManchester United: Bayındır, Shaw (Kambwala Ndengushi 82), Martinez (Maguire 89), Varane (Evans 90+7), Diogo Dalot, Casimiro (McTominay 81), Mainoo, Borges Fernandes, Garnacho, Antony (Forson 88), HøjlundGoals: 0:1 - 7  Borges Fernandes (Antony), 0:2 - 13  Mainoo (Diogo Dalot), 1:2 - 36  Morris, 2:2 - 47  Evans (Lewis), 2:3 - 68  Antony, 2:4 - 90+4  HøjlundCards: Casimiro (72)BOOMERANG.BETN1BETMEGAPARITIPICOBET365888 STAKE BOOMERANG.BETPIN UPPOKERSTARSSportsbooksCasinoBest bookmakersLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...All bookmakers"

Well, according to The Athletic, it's not too soon to presume Guardiola's heading in that direction. Klopp has announced he will leave Liverpool at the end of this season. Considering his influence for the Merseysiders, who are on course to win another Premier League title, fans won't be too sad to see him go. Another nemesis for Man United is, of course, Guardiola, who has single-handedly set exceptionally high standards for the Premier League. Fortunately, The Athletic understands Pep is unlikely to stick around and may look to return to Barcelona once his contract expires at the end of next season. Guardiola was being linked with a departure even in 2022/23, which ended with Man City winning the treble. With INEOS in charge and the Glazers' power diminishing, it's the perfect time for Man United to capitalise on this shift in the Premier League.

Step forward Marten De Roon: the Dutch midfielder headed home in the 90+1 minute sealing an away draw for the Boro. ‘It’s never over until it’s over’ never felt so right.Soccer Mom: Picking Teams to Bet by Sound of NamesPicture this: you’re a life-long football fan with deep knowledge of the game.

Even dedicated Manchester United fans would hardly remember the kid who joined the Red Devils academy in 2002. That same year Ryan’s father Mick placed a £100 bet (odds 100/1) that his then-nine-year-old son would one day play for the Manchester United seniors. It took the bet ten years to come in! In the summer of 2012, Ryan returned to Man United from a loan spell at Peterborough. On September 26, 2012, he was picked for the Capital One Cup (now Carabao Cup) clash against Newcastle and helped his side to the 2-1 win and the proud dad to a £10,000 windfall.Mick Tunnicliffe was proudly watching his son play for Man United seniors for the first timeIt didn’t work out for Ryan at Old Trafford though.

Scored a beautiful goal to give Chelsea the lead and then saw them squander it. Tried his best to create chances with some nice final third passes and had some shots go wide, but didn’t get enough cooperation from his teammates.Djordje Petrovic – 6.5Even though Petrovic conceded four goals, it could’ve been way worse if not for him. He made a few brilliant saves to deny Wolves and was REALLY not helped by how sloppy his defenders were.Enzo Fernandez – 6.5The Argentine midfielder did lose the ball leading to the third, but did his job decently apart from that. He moved the ball around well and completed over 70 passes with 91% accuracy, and created two chances too – which were wasted.Moises Caicedo – 4Caicedo had a strange game, which were mostly involved in lows. He did get his first assist of the season, setting up Palmer’s goal with a beautiful pass. But then things started going wrong, as Caicedo gave the ball away for the equalizer and kept constantly losing the ball and made zero tackles.Raheem Sterling – 4Sterling had an extremely inefficient game and never looked to be a major threat in terms of creativity, failing to create anything. He had a huge scoring chance early in the second half, but blasted the shot over the bar – summing up his poor outing.Malo Gusto – 3Gusto had a nightmare against Wolves’ counter-attacks and could not do much to neutralize their threat on the left at all. Won just 2/13 duels, couldn’t make any tackles and then gave away the penalty with a silly foul in the box. Also booked and had to be taken off soon after that.SubstitutesSilva – 5, Disasi – 4.5, Chilwell – 5, Gallagher – 4.5, Nkunku – 6SubstitutesJackson – 5, Mudryk – 7, Chukwuemaka – 6, Badiashile – N/R, Gilchrist – N/ RChelsea – Wolverhampton Wanderers 2:4 (1:2, 1:2)4 février, 14:00, Stamford BridgeStatisticsLineupsTableAll matchesChelsea: Petrović, Chilwell (Badiashile 81), Thiago Silva, Disasi, Gusto (Gilchrist 81), Fernández, Caicedo Corozo (Jackson 63), Gallagher, Palmer, Sterling (Mudryk 72), Nkunku (Chukwuemeka 72)Wolverhampton Wanderers: Malheiro de Sá, Gomes, Dawson, Kilman, Pablo Sarabia (Doyle 72), Matheus Cunha, Aït Nouri (Bueno 87), Semedo, Gomes (Doherty 90), Lemina, Neto (Bellegarde 72)Goals: 1:0 - 19  Palmer (Caicedo Corozo), 1:1 - 22  Matheus Cunha (Gomes), 1:2 - 43  Disasi (o.g.), 1:3 - 63  Matheus Cunha (Neto), 1:4 - 82  Matheus Cunha (pen.), 2:4 - 86  Thiago Silva (Mudryk)Cards: Gusto (30), Semedo (38), Neto (41), Caicedo Corozo (56), Chilwell (78)BOOMERANG.BETN1BETMEGAPARIPARIPESATIPICO888 STAKE BOOMERANG.BETPIN UPPOKERSTARSSportsbooksCasinoBest bookmakersLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...All bookmakers"

Watch the video to find out why the Monkeys chose to support the club, which one band member supports city rivals Sheffield United and, on the footballing side of things, how Wednesday pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks ever."

Three Man City players with contracts expiring in less than 18 months,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-30-three-man-city-players-with-contracts-expiring-in-less-than-18-months/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Tribuna.com,2024-01-30T08:35:00.000Z,"Man City have set themselves up to be in a strong position to fight for another European Treble in the 2023/24 season after their heroics from the previous campaign.The Cityzens are five points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool (with a game in hand). They dispatched off Tottenham Hotspur to move into the fifth round of the FA Cup (where they’ll face Luton Town) and are set to face FC Copenhagen in the Champions League Round of 16.Pep Guardiola’s side is stacked with a high-quality squad and with a plethora of options in nearly every single position on the pitch. Off the pitch, they are a well-run organization that works swiftly and efficiently in tying down players to long-term contracts.With that being said, there are some interesting Man City players whose contracts are currently scheduled to expire in less than 18 months (after the end of the 2024/25 season). Here they are.Kevin de BruyneThe Belgian star has been a pivotal part of Man City’s success in the Guardiola era. He made an amazing return from injury recently, having contributed a goal and two assists in his last three appearances since coming back. De Bruyne’s contract, however, is currently set to expire on June 30, 2025. That means that if unable to agree a new deal before the end of the season, the summer window could be especially interesting for the 32-year-old. De Bruyne isn’t getting younger and Man City are a team that always builds for future success, so it’ll be interesting to see how they handle his contract situation.Stefan OrtegaThe Man City no.2 goalkeeper has actually produced some solid performances as a back-up for Ederson, having kept two clean sheets in the FA Cup this season. He’s a solid shot-stopper and especially impressive in moving the ball around. Ortega’s current contract is set to expire at the end of the 2024/25 season. Man City haven’t shown any interest in extending it yet, as they might want to see a few more performances before deciding whether or not to keep him for the long term.Zack SteffanSteffan was recently loaned out to MLS side Colorado Rapids for the remainder of the season and has spent the majority of the last few seasons out on loan. His contract expires at the end of June next year and at this point, it doesn’t seem like Man City has long-term plans for the USMNT star."

The Athletic understands Man United are yet to formally approach Southampton for Wilcox but the 52-year-old is aware of their interest. While details of Wilcox's exact role are unclear, the report claims he would report to the sporting director - potentially, Ashworth in this case. Wilcox is credited with discovering players like Phil Foden and Chelsea's Cole Palmer during his time at Man City.

New formation? 3 ways Klopp could fit Thiago in Liverpool's new-look midfield,https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-31-new-formation-3-ways-klopp-could-fit-thiago-in-liverpools-newlook-midfield/,Aleksei Blokhin,tribuna.com,2024-01-31T14:29:06.000Z,"Thiago rejoined team training on Monday, Jurgen Klopp confirmed in his pre-Chelsea press conference. While it would take a while to bring the Spaniard back to match fitness, the news begs the question of how the 32-year-old would fit into Liverpool's midfield setup.The arrivals of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Wataru Endo, as well as the insane progress of Curtis Jones, mean that Thiago is no longer an automatic starter when he's fit.So assuming he'd be fit in a few weeks' time, here are three ways the Reds could line up with the Spaniard.1. In his natural positionThiago's natural position is that of a left-sided central midfielder. This is where Curtis Jones currently plays and the Spaniard will replace the Scouser in the starting XI.2. As a no. 6CuJo is arguably the most in-form player at Liverpool right now: dropping him, as suggested above, just doesn't make sense. Fortunately, Thiago is quite versatile: he can play as a no. 6. Apart from being excellent in passing, the 32-year-old stats last season showed that he was consistently the best tackler in the squad. He also makes a crazy number of interceptions per game — so his qualities suit the position of a holding midfielder.Mac Allister has learnt the holding role really, really well while Wataru Endo was dropping 10/10 performances as a no. 6 before he left for the Asian Cup. But we can still see Thiago here. 3. New formationLiverpool now have an insane amount of talent in the midfield. Why not get the most of them and play an extra midfielder at the expense of a forward? Klopp has shown that he can change the system mid-season: last term, he began playing Trent in a hybrid role which changed how the whole team operates. Of course, the Reds were in crisis when he made that change so the circumstances forced the manager to get creative.There is much less need for Klopp to reinvent the team but why not experiment in the FA Cup or the Europa League and see if it works?"

However, 23 became unavailable upon his move to Manchester City, retired in honour of the late Marc-Vivien Foe since 2003.During his Etihad tenure, Phillips wore the number four.

'This would be a bold move': Carragher insists Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham must be picked together for England,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-06-this-would-be-a-bold-move-carragher-insists-phil-foden-and-jude-bellingham-must-be-picked/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Daily Mail,2024-02-06T08:13:06.000Z,"After Phil Foden's hat-trick heroics in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Brentford, Jamie Carragher is urging Gareth Southgate to start Foden and Jude Bellingham together for England. Foden's standout performance in a central role has sparked post-match praise, with Carragher emphasizing the potential of this dynamic duo for the national team.Quoted by Daily Mail, after the game, Carragher said: 'It's really interesting what he said about playing more centrally. In terms of natural-born talent in the England squad, you think Jude Bellingham is perhaps the only one who can go up against him.""""What Bellingham has done in the last 18 months is almost make the England team his own where the team is going to be built around him. I thought that was going to be Phil Foden two or three years ago. It hasn't quite happened.""""When he plays for City, you're never quite sure if he's going to be playing on the right, on the left or central. I don't think that's helped him.""Carragher continued: ""I think it is a bit of a conundrum for the England manager. If Bellingham is at No 10, does that mean Foden has to be on the left with Bukayo Saka on the right? The fact he's had to move positions so often has probably hindered him.""""I thought when David Silva moved on, it would be his natural next step to play more centrally as a left-footed but it didn't happen. It feels Pep Guardiola puts a lot on playing centrally and thought he could learn the game better playing wider.""""For England, there is no reason why he can't play in that position. I think criticism of Gareth Southgate being too defensive can be a little over the top, but this would be a bold move, and why not when you've got players of that quality. In Spain, he and Bellingham would play as two No 8s.""Joleon Lescott reveals his pick for 'the best player England have produced'"

Carvalho and Williams have already been sent out on new loans.Out of the aforementioned six players, only Beck had a successful loan. The Welshman made 20 appearances for Dundee but was brought back to Liverpool amid a shortage of players in the left-back position.The other loans ranged from disappointment to disaster. Carvalho made 15 appearances for Leipzig with no goals or assists, Phillips played just eight games for Celtic, Ramsay featured only twice for Preston, Koumetio played nine times for Dunkerque and Williams failed to make a single appearance for Aberdeen.It hasn't always been this way though. Last season, Liverpool sent Conor Bradley on a highly successful loan to League One side Bolton, where he played 52 games, recording seven goals and five assists. Harvey Elliott spent the 2020/21 campaign with Blackburn in the Championship, scoring seven goals and providing seven assists in 41 appearances. Both players broke into the Reds' first team after their loans.Remember Marko Grujic? Liverpool made a £5.4m profit on the midfielder after Porto bought him in 2021 following a successful year on loan at Estadio do Dragao. Rhian Brewster scored 11 goals in 22 appearances for Swansea on loan in the 2019/20 season, leading to Sheffield United splashing £23.5m on the striker. Neco Williams was sold to Forest on a £17m deal after impressing the scouts in his six months on loan with Fulham.Liverpool have proven over time that they can pick excellent loans for their players, finding a place where they fully develop.

At his age, I don’t know how many games he has played, how many titles he has won.""""He can play in five positions. When you play in the central positions, that quality is there. When he plays wide we also have the sense that he can create something in tight games when the spaces are so small.""""He played two games in World Cup and since then, his impact has been decisive.

We hope that it's going to be a very good thing for us.“The players deserve it because they've been working very hard since the beginning of the season. We need to put it all together, behave in the way we behaved at Villa.

De Jong's current deal ends in 2026 but Barca wants him to commit until the summer of 2028 with sporting director Deco pushing to get the deal done with the midfielder before the end of the season. However, Barca's desperation isn't solely because they want to keep the player, the club are looking at amortising his salary to reduce their wage bill and allow the club to register new players. For now, De Jong's entourage are unwilling to enter negotiations. The Dutchman remains Barca's highest-paid player and the club continues to seek ways to unhook themselves from the burden he places on their payroll. It could all end up with De Jong getting sold in the summer if Barca cannot reach an agreement with the player. Barca still believes they can easily get €100m for Frenkie considering they've been offered that much before, notably from Manchester United and Chelsea. The only problem Barca would have in their plan is the player himself. If De Jong doesn't want to leave Barca won't be able to force him out as was the case in the summer of 2022.

Carvajal's current deal expires in the summer of 2025 and the club intends to secure his future as he's one of the strongest characters in the dressing room and a key player for Carlo Ancelotti. Real Madrid's plan for Carvajal after 2026 will be to extend his contract year after year as is the case with Madrid players who are above the age of 31. Carvajal is having a remarkable season which has seen him re-establish himself as one of the best fullbacks in the world. The Spaniard has played 23 times for Real Madrid this season, netting four goals and assisting three more. Carvajal is a jewel from Real Madrid's Castilla having been at the club since the age of 10. However, between 2012 and 2013 he spent a season in Germany after Madrid sold him to Bayer Leverkusen for €5m. Los Blancos bought him back for €6.5m and he's been a key player ever since.

After the game, they sat down in Barca's cafeteria. Football agent Josep Maria Minguella joined them.From left to right: Horacio Gaggioli, Carles Rexach and Josep Maria Minguella:According to Marca, Gaggioli and Minguella pressured Rexach to make a quick decision about Messi. Rexach took a napkin and wrote:""In Barcelona, on Dec. 14, 2000, in the presence of [Josep Maria] Minguella and Horacio [Gaggioli], Carles Rexach, FC Barcelona's sporting director, hereby agrees, under his responsibility and regardless of any dissenting opinions, to sign the player Lionel Messi provided that we keep to the amounts agreed upon.""Rexach, Minguella and Gaggioli then signed the napkin. Interestingly, from Rexach's point of view, the decision was all his and Minguella and Gaggioli didn't need to convince him.""Messi? I signed him in 30 seconds,"" Rexach said. ""In my 40 years of football, I had never seen anything like it. Out of five goal situations, he converts four. And he has exceptional skills. They reminded me of the prime Maradona.""I signed his first contract, symbolically, on a napkin: I wanted to hire him as soon as possible, couldn't let him slip away.""Does that famous napkin still exist and if yes, where is it now?According to Infobae (h/t/ Marca), the legendary piece of paper belongs to Horacio Gaggioli. The former Messi's representative lives in Andorra today. The napkin is stored in a safe of the Credit Andorra bank.Gaggioli has received many messages from all parts of the world with offers to sell the napkin but his answer has always been a firm 'no'.""I think the napkin should be in the Barcelona museum,"" he said in 2018. ""That piece of paper changed the modern history of the club. I think it should be there, preferably next to Messi's Ballon d'Or's.""Horacio Gaggioli with the famous napkin contact:There have been contacts between Gaggioli and Barca's museum but the negotiations stopped after the club suggested that the 'napkin deal' was a 'confidential contract' that was not supposed to be exposed. Gaggioli objected: ""While it was always considered to be a kind of contract, it was really a commitment without any money changing hands. I was always in favour of the napkin being displayed in the museum, and if one day it leaves [the bank in] Andorra, that is where it will go.""That day hasn't come yet: even though Leo Messi is no longer at the club, the napkin is still in the bank safe."

The next three games are against Getafe, Atletico Madrid and Girona. Thus, the game against Getafe on Thursday is up next for Los Blancos and they just have to win.

Ocampos was shocked when a fan poked him in the anus as he went to take a throw-in. The stunned player turned around to scold the fan before calling the attention of the Rayo players and referee. Here's a video of the incident. Ocampos would later call for a stiff penalty for the offending fan while drawing a comparison to what usually happens when women are involved. A good example is the case involving former Spain FA boss Luis Rubiales and Barcelona Femeni icon Jenni Hermoso. ""If it happens in women's football we already know what can happen,"" Ocampos said. ""I held back because I have two daughters and I hope that tomorrow it doesn't happen to them,"" said the winger. ""I didn't know who it was, I wanted to hit them. I have two daughters, and I didn't want my daughters to go to school and have people tell them that their father hit someone,"" the player added. Ocampos is probably spot on. Rubiales was stripped of his role as a FIFA executive and forced to resign his position as Spain RFEF president for kissing Hermoso on the lips during the women's World Cup final celebrations last year. However, the case involving Ocampos was not with a high-ranking public figure but a young and naive football fan. La Liga are yet to comment on the incident."

The duo reportedly had a row during the 2022 World Cup as well, arguing over Cameroon playing out from the back. This time, he was particularly miffed at manager Rigobert Song decision to bench him and confronted Eto'o about it. However, Onana was unable to justify being selected which ultimately led to this situation. He missed Cameroon's opening 1-1 draw with Guinea to play for Man United in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. The Red Devils reportedly flew him to the AFCON in a private jet, which cost a cool £79,000. He then started in the crushing 3-1 defeat to Senegal and was benched against Gambia subsequently. Cameroon won that game 3-2 and managed to qualify for the Round of 16. As per the report, they may choose to rely on Fabrice Ondoa, Onana's cousin, to play between the sticks beyond this. Andre Onana has worst save success rate at AFCON after two rounds — 0%"

It's a foul.""""But if I started to go through the steps of his poor defending in that moment, you should just be quiet. He should say 'you know what, actually, the situation isn't clear cut either way but his opinion is that'. It's not bias is it? But these man can't take it sometimes.""Ferdinand also stated that pundits giving their opinions is simply part of the game.He added: ""When it comes to performance and you're critiquing performance - it's fair game, part of the game is critiquing performance, it's normal.""That's why I embraced social media early because I didn't like that every single time they done a caricature of me, they done some mad s***, with bling this and bling that.""""I like nice things but I that isn't representing me properly.

Real Madrid v Almeria refereeing scandal: all we know so far,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-23-real-madrid-v-almeria-refereeing-scandal-all-we-know-so-far/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Tribuna.com,2024-01-23T12:45:00.000Z,"Real Madrid went 1-0 down to Almeria in the first minute of the game and conceded another towards the end of the first half — an unprecedented outcome given Almeria are rock bottom and winless all season. It took Real Madrid three controversial refereeing episodes and time until minute 67’ to equalise, and one more cheesy call to enable the winning goal. But let’s go episode by episode.The controversies1. Controversial penalty call. Real Madrid's 'comeback' began with a divisive penalty before the hour-mark. The VAR officials noticed an apparent handball by an Almeria player while contesting for a corner, giving them a free-kick.However, before the ball even hit the player's arm, Antonio Rudiger was clearly seen lunging on the back of an opposition player and clearly fouling him. The officials opted to see past that and stick with the penalty, which was converted by Jude Bellingham.2. Almeria denied a third goal. As Almeria were still leading 2-1, they had a golden chance to score a third — which they did. However, the goal was disallowed for an alleged foul in the build-up. As an Almeria player was shielding the ball, his hands touched Jude Bellingham’s face. The referee Hernandez Maesco was right in front and saw nothing wrong with it until the VAR Hernandez Hernandez intervened.3. Madrid equalise seemingly through handball. Just six minutes after Almeria were denied a third goal, Real Madrid found their equalizer through what came off as a blatant handball from Vinicius Jr. The winger guided the ball into the goal with what looked like a part of his arm. Even after a VAR check, the goal was given as officials felt it hit his shoulder - with football rules accepting goals from a player's shoulder. 4. Vinicius spared for elbowing his opponent. The final episode in the chain of controversies happened in minute 87’ with the scoreline 2-2. Vinicius elbowed his opponent in the face as the ball wasn’t even moving in his direction. The VAR room spoke to the on-field referee and both concluded it was fair play. Almeria's protestAlmeria manager Gaizka Garitano was infuriated to see his side robbed in the second half. He got sent off towards the end for protesting the referee's decision and fumed after the game, saying: ""I don’t usually talk about referees but everyone has seen this game and it’s not the first time this has happened to me here. Then we get penalised for talking, my opinion is worthless. What can I say. I have no words to describe what happened today.""Gonzalo Melero, their midfielder, called out the robbery and said: ""We are leaving with the feeling that we were robbed. I don’t think we could have done more from the off to put them in the game. There’s no way to accept it. What happened today was beyond all limits.""Almeria are still up in arms about the result and continued their protest after the win on social media. They posted a cheeky picture hinting that goals scored by Real Madrid with the use of hands are as legal as headed goals. Gerard Romero leaks audioMeanwhile, pro-Barcelona journalist Gerard Romero fueled the fire even further by posting a leaked audio clip that indicated that Vini Jr should've been sent off for an elbow on an opponent. Romero posted an audio clip where the VAR referee, Hernandez Hernandez, seemed to indicate that he saw a foul from Vini towards an Almeria player. Here's how the conversation went.Hernández Hernández (VAR): Possible foul in attack. I want to see. A little further back, a little further back (...) Ugh, I want to see it in short.Hernández Maeso (Referee): For me it is a struggle between both of us. He complains about his face but I don't see anything.Hernández Hernández: When he's going to take it off, when he's going to take it off with his arm... when he strokes it, it hits him in the face .Hernández Hernández: Let's go live.The journalist obviously did not take permission from the Spanish referee committee, who as per Cadena SER, have opened an investigation on how this audio from the VAR room was accessed by Romero.There are also investigations being made on why the incident was not reviewed on the VAR monitor by the match official Francisco Hernandez Maeso if a possible foul by Vini was spotted.Barca's reactionBarcelona fans were understandably infuriated with the manner in which Real Madrid basically stole three points. Xavi ventured his frustration at the poor officiating, claiming that it'll be very tough for Barca to win the La Liga title if referees keep favouring Real Madrid."

He said: ""And then listen Phillips, I don't know what he's trying. The way I look at it, he's sluggish.

Rashford got into a major argument with the woman after she accused him of kissing another girl earlier that evening. Things got so bad that Rashford eventually threw the French woman out of the hotel room followed by her clothes. Staff at the hotel, including a waitress who was also there at the club, have confirmed these events. The report also adds that other guests at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, a five-star place, were left shocked at the loud row.

Barca board members continue 'dreaming of Xabi Alonso',https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-12-barca-board-members-continue-dreaming-of-xabi-alonso-reliability-4-stars/,Kingsley_,Diario Sport,2024-02-12T12:45:00.000Z,"Barcelona board members are dreaming of having Xabi Alonso as their head coach from next season, Diario Sport say. The board members consider Alonso an ideal candidate given the brand of football his Bayer Leverkusen team plays. But beyond that, they believe Alonso would suit Barca having grown up in Barcelona surroundings where he was raised by his father Periko Alonso — who played for Barca in the mid-80s. Alonso has been doing remarkably well at Leverkusen this season with his team still the only unbeaten side in Europe so far this campaign. They've scored 92 goals in 31 games now.Recently, Leverkusen thoroughly humiliated Bayern Munich with a 3-0 win in the Bundesliga where they lead by five points. Alonso has a contract at Bayer until 2025 and will be quite difficult to price away considering he's also wanted by Liverpool.

How Xavi can make Barca stop Victor Osimhen – shown by Ivory Coast in AFCON final,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-14-how-xavi-can-make-barca-stop-victor-osimhen-shown-by-ivory-coast-in-afcon-final/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-02-14T11:23:00.000Z,"Victor Osimhen was tipped to be the main hero of the Africa Cup of Nations final between Nigeria and Ivory Coast. However, the Eagle ended up being a sparrow: he finished the game with no goals or even shots, made just eight passes and lost half of duels. Oh, and the 2-1 defeat flattered Nigeria.How did it happen? Let’s take a look at the Elephants’ lucky formula and how Xavi can implement it against Napoli in the Champions League.What was Nigeria’s own plan for Osimhen?Osimhen was doing way more than just waiting for the ball to come to his feet: early in the first half already, the striker dropped deeper to look for link-ups and make Nigeria’s attacks more structured. This had to do with a big gap between the midfield and the attack as the former were located too deep.While Osimhen is far from being the best link-up striker in the world (he’s surely better than Lewandowski in this regard, though!), Ivory Coast still paid a lot of attention to his involvement in attacks and tried to close him down collectively.Here, for example, Osimhen tries to escape from his marker and provide Samuel Chukwueze with a quick lightweight pass. The ball doesn’t reach its destination as Chukwueze is being followed by the right winger (!) Max Gradel. The attack is stopped. At Barca, we may imagine Raphinha emulating what Gradel does here.In another episode, Osimhen wins the ball after a throw-in before trying to link up with his teammates up front. The immediate reaction of Ivory Coast players is brilliant as they close him down in numbers and manage to steal the ball without a foul.Expectedly, Nigeria also tried to send floated crosses into the box to find Osimhen (Napoli often look for him with crosses) – that’s when powerful left-footed centre-back Evan Ndicka, a former Barca target, came into action. We think it’s crucial for Barca to start Inigo Martinez who is great at minimising the aerial threat.Who was man-marking Osimhen?This job was mostly done by Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Odilon Kossounou who did very well and had Osimhen in his pocket starting from minute one.Nigeria often tried to find Osimhen with a long ball coming from one of the defenders or the goalkeeper. Kossounou had to make sure the striker didn't break away from him. Here he did a great job by pulling out and intercepting the ball.Even late in the game, when Nigeria were pushing for an equaliser, Kossounou remained rock-solid in his head-to-head clashes against Osimhen.Look how confident he was while trying to avoid pressure from Victor. Wow.The Barca player who can do the same stuff against Osimhen is surely Ronald Araujo, also a right centre-back who’s even taller than Kossounou. We need him in his absolute top form against Napoli.One thing Araujo shouldn’t risk doing is going with the ball forward. Firstly, he is not great at it; secondly, Osimhen may punish him for that. Shortly after Kossounou did it and Ivory Coast lost possession, they got exposed defensively as Nigeria almost launched a dangerous counterattack.Osimhen once again dropped deeper, collected the ball from Zaidu and beat Kossounou with a backheel pass Nigeria failed to capitalise on.How did Osimhen try to get out of Kossounou’s pocket?By moving to the wings – that’s how he started the second half, often switching to the right and sometimes to the left as Nigeria were trying to attack in different ways after a poor first half in which they somehow found the net.At some point, Osimhen’s marker was experienced left-back Ghislain Konan who also did well in head-to-head battles. It’s quite concerning that Barca’s left-back is going to be Joao Cancelo (who is really weak defensively), but at least he’s got pace, like Konan.Collective effort was still key for Ivory Coast in the second half: when Osimhen was trying to connect with his teammates, they kept surrounding him and cutting his oxygen off.While the Elephants were superb at containing Victor Osimhen, it’s worth mentioning that they managed to stop the vast majority of Nigeria’s attacks long before the ball could’ve got to the striker – even despite the latter’s contribution in the build-up.Osimhen heat map v Ivory CoastWhat should Barca XI v Napoli be?Defence-minded (at least for the first leg), filled with powerful centre-backs who are pacy enough to contain Osimhen’s rapid runs and full-backs who can track the striker’s movement on the wings.Here is our preferred option.Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, Inigo, Cancelo; Pedri, De Jong, Gundogan; Yamal, Lewandowski, Raphinha.- Only the best-available centre-backs in: no error-prone Andreas Christensen and Pau Cubarsi;- Ronald Araujo and Inigo Martinez should definitely start for their superb ability to win aerial duels;- Joao Cancelo is the weakest link at the back but he can be supported by Raphinha who is solid defensively – he could help contain Osimhen when the Nigerian moves to his right."

Apparently, Thomas Tuchel is a big fan of the defender and the German club were ready to stump up 80 million euros for the 24-year-old.However, according to The Athletic, Xavi staunchly opposed the idea, even threatening to resign if the board sanctioned the sale. Consequently, Araujo remained at Barca, while Bayern opted for a short-term loan deal with Eric Dier to cover at CB, leaving the door ajar for a renewed pursuit of the Uruguayan in the summer, though.As for the Catalans, President Laporta had earlier promised a summer squad revolution with the goal of generating €200 million, meaning the Catalans will need to let go of several key players in June.Given that Xavi recently announced his decision to leave the team at the end of the season anyway, it begs the question: may the Uruguayan be joining him on the way out?Barcelona plan 'squad revolution' to generate €200m – we name 15 players who could leave"

"Michel at Chelsea: tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-15-michel-at-chelsea-tactical-profile-biggest-strengths-and-possible-xis/,Michael Ellis,Tribuna.com,2024-02-15T21:27:00.000Z,"At least for a while, Mauricio Pochettino may have steadied the ship at Chelsea — but bookmakers still take bets on the next manager to be in charge of the Blues.One of the names at the top of the list is Michel, the head coach of La Liga's surprise package Girona. In 2021, the former midfielder took over Girona in the second tier. Two and a half years later, they sit comfortably second in La Liga, well ahead of Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. How did that happen?Tactical styleAs a smaller club from Catalonia, Girona have looked up to Barcelona for a long time. This season, however, a serious argument can be made that they play better Barcelona-style than the traditional giants.Under Michel, Girona builds up from the back, with three field players and occasionally the goalkeeper participating. In the final third, it's fluid, depending on the players at Michel's disposal. The attacking group is joined by at least one wing-back, depending on whether Girona plays with three of four at the back out of possession. They can overload the flanks and create space for central players to make third-player runs, with Aleix Garcia as the main ball distributor in the middle of the pitch.Up front, Artem Dovbyk is a physical presence but can also make runs in behind. In his absence, Girona can even play with a false nine. Whoever is on the pitch, the end product is usually there: this season, they have scored more than two goals per game on average.WeaknessesThings are not so rosy at the other end of the pitch. In the top half of the La Liga table, only two teams have conceded more goals than Girona (29 goals conceded in 24 games at the time of writing).Four of those goals were scored in a top-of-the-table clash with Real Madrid. Girona effectively folded after letting in the first goal in the 6th minute. We're yet to see how Michel's team will respond to such a setback in the medium term.Lack of experience can also count against the 48-year-old. Pochettino is just three years older than him but has coached in more than twice the number of games that Michel has — and for the latter, a lot of those matches were in the second tier.The Spaniard's rise with Girona has been spectacular, but this is the first time when his side is fighting for any major trophy. A jump to the Premier League, especially to such a demanding club like Chelsea, could be too soon for him.Probable lineupsGirona have played with both a back three and a back four under Michel, so we'll consider both of these possibilities.If Chelsea are affected by the Financial Fair Play and can make no signings, Michel may play with a false nine. Christopher Nkunku seems to be the best option, although Cole Palmer also has the experience now.Chelsea are still likely to sign a No.9, and Michel wants a player who can be both a physical presence and a runner in behind the defence. You're not likely to find anyone better than Victor Osimhen.❓ Would you like to see Michel coaching Chelsea next season?

Kieran Trippier could receive stunning bonus if he joins Bayern Munich,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-23-kieran-trippier-could-receive-stunning-bonus-if-he-joins-bayern-munich/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Fabrizio Romano,2024-01-23T10:41:31.000Z,"Kieran Trippier might be in line for an unusual but substantial bonus if he makes a move from Newcastle United to Bayern Munich. Newcastle brought Trippier back to the Premier League for £12 million, making him the vice-captain. However, despite extending his contract until 2025, there are talks of him leaving for Bayern Munich, who is keen on signing the 33-year-old full-back.However, according to Fabrizio Romano, it will be a tough deal for Bayern: ""Newcastle insist on their position: no plans to sell Kieran Trippier in January despite Bayern insistence in the recent days. It's a complicated deal for Bayern.""If Trippier joins Thomas Tuchel, who has already recruited Eric Dier, and former Tottenham teammate Harry Kane at Bayern Munich, he could receive a delicious bonus. While player salaries in German clubs, including Bayern, are not as high as in the Premier League, Bundesliga teams often pay bonuses ranging from £6,000 to £18,000 per point won.

According to Statman Dave, the Manchester United midfielder has notched up 127 actions so far - the highest across the best leagues in Europe in 2023/24. Bruno is easily among Man United's most valuable players but he's often criticised for losing the ball too easily while in possession.

Despite facing challenges this season with a foot injury that caused him to miss 12 games, Haaland has still managed to score 19 goals in 24 games across all competitions.Scoring goals definitely makes Erling Haaland happy, however, there is one thing the Norwegian dislikes about football - throw-ins. In a recent episode of the Manchester City podcast, Haaland revealed that he finds throw-ins annoying. He also admitted that he doesn't fully grasp the rules surrounding them. He said: ""What annoys me is the throw-ins. I'd change that - just have two hands on the ball. We will see what happens in the future but you need a certain time limit to take throw-ins and you cannot take too many metres - just give a mark and you can only go there.""Haaland's recent revelation might be linked to a specific incident. In December, during City's 2-1 victory against Luton, the team faced a penalty for a foul throw. This match was crucial as City rallied from behind to secure the win, preventing a fifth consecutive game without a victory.Haaland continued: ""If you throw like this or this or whatever, it doesn't matter.

Real Madrid emerges best club in Europe in one department on the pitch,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-27-real-madrid-emerges-best-club-in-europe-in-one-department-on-the-pitch/,Kingsley_,theathletic.com,2024-01-27T08:57:41.000Z,"Real Madrid are the only team in all of Europe's top five leagues who are yet to concede a goal from a set piece this season, The Athletic reports. Defensive solidity in set-piece situations has become a massive strength for Carlo Ancelotti's side and as a result, they are the strongest defensive side in La Liga and the best defence for set-pieces in Europe. Madrid have only conceded 10 goals from set-pieces since Ancelotti became their manager in 2021. Only Manchester City (11) comes close in that regard with  Barca (16) completing the top 3 in Europe. It shows the thorough work Ancelotti has put into his defence since he returned for a second stint at Real Madrid. Ancelotti says he sets up his defence to be ""pessimistic and full of concentration"" when facing set-piece situations. It means Madrid applies extra caution and proactiveness in such situations with players like Antonio Rudiger being a key protagonist. Real Madrid also acknowledges the intense work of their set-piece coach Mauri and the other analysts. Mauri works with the players to anticipate the physical attributes of their rivals and anticipate their movement in the box and how they attack set-piece. It's all like a game of chess for Real Madrid, The Athletic say.As a result, Real Madrid have only conceded 57 shots from set-pieces this season, the fourth-lowest in La Liga, but they're the only team yet to concede a goal from such a situation, not even in the Champions League. Real Madrid will be looking to extend their immaculate defensive record with set-pieces when they travel to face Las Palmas later today, January 27th."

Сreating the perfect coach out of 10 gaffers and their hallmark attributes,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-06-reating-the-perfect-coach-out-of-10-gaffers-and-their-hallmark-attributes/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-02-06T21:48:33.000Z,"Compiling the perfect football coach involves considering a blend of philosophies, tactics, man-management skills and leadership qualities. We’ve come up with our own compilation using attributes from multiple famous managers.Tactical wizard: Pep GuardiolaFrom re-inventing tiki-taka (although he doesn’t like it to be called that way!) at Barcelona to constantly dominating the Premier League with Manchester City, Pep Guardiola is easily the best tactician one may hire.The Catalan wouldn’t have been this successful if he had continued asking his teams to play the Barcelona way. While his main emphasis is still put on dominating possession and defending by keeping the ball, Pep has become more flexible, especially in big games: perhaps the biggest highlight of the treble-winning 2022/23 season was beating Arsenal with just 36 per cent possession but clinical finishing.Guardiola’s players evolve as much as his teams do: it was him to create a legendary false-nine role for Leo Messi; him to transform Phillip Lahm into a fantastic holding midfielder; him to turn John Stones into a high-quality defensive midfielder; him to make Nathan Ake a superb inverted full-back – the move that made the long-awaited treble possible. Sometimes he overthinks too much, but 11 league titles in 15 years as a coach prove his ideas are always relevant.Man-management: Carlo AncelottiOne of the most player-centric coaches of our time, Ancelotti knows perfectly what it means to be on the same page with his squad. At Chelsea, he used to discuss his training methods with the team and allow them to make game-plan suggestions, gradually adjusting his tactical style to their preferences. This didn’t mean he would just bend to them, though: he had no problem benching Didier Drogba when the latter was late to training. It’s all about balance and finding the best solution for everyone.In his second stint with Real Madrid, the Italian built a team jokingly called ‘Friendship FC’ for their outstanding cohesion. Vids of him dancing with his players after the Champions League glory of 2022 still go viral from time to time.‘He’s like a big teddy bear. He’s really sensitive and is a great guy. He would speak to us every day. Not just to me but to all the players,’ Cristiano Ronaldo once said, adding that every player should get the chance to work with Don Carlo.Conditioning: Antonio ConteIf your club are targeting Antonio Conte as their next head coach, you know the players won’t be hanging around on a training ground while all layabouts will be kicked away – but this will possibly result in a league title (or even three in a row depending on the league).Right upon taking over at Chelsea, the Italian surprised his players with exhausting running sessions already during the preseason, even John Terry admitting he had never experienced anything like that in his 18 years at the club. The word ‘exhausting’ perfectly describes everything else that happens during Conte’s training sessions: Eden Hazard once revealed the Italian would often ask the players to repeat one simple passing drill to complete automatism.Conte also had strict rules regarding the players’ diet and… sex, revealing that they should make as little effort as possible and refrain from long-lasting sexual relationships.Attacking: Marcelo BielsaBielsa’s recognisable tactical approach involves relentless pressing and incredibly fast ball circulation. He managed to display his attacking outlook in England when his Leeds United ended a Premier League season with 62 goals scored right after promotion – only five teams found the net more often in that 20/21 campaign.El Colo puts some immense emphasis on physical preparation. No surprise one of the Argentine’s training approaches is called ‘Murderball’: this is like the No Rules mode on FIFA when players divide into two teams and play offensive football without any free kicks, throw-ins, fouls or other stoppages. One day Bielsa even stunned Leeds’ youth side, asking them to play this way.Despite all that, Bielsa is first and foremost a brilliant tactician. After getting sacked by Leeds, he revealed he had watched all the 380 matches of the preceding La Liga season as he was eyeing a comeback to Athletic Club.Defending: Jose MourinhoWhile the Portuguese is jokingly described as a park-the-bus coach nowadays, he actually revolutionised the Premier League with his defensive approach back in the day, making the general tactical trend less direct and straightforward.Prime Jose built a dream Chelsea team that only conceded 13 goals and kept 24 clean sheets in the 2004/05 season. This was also the campaign when almost half of the Blues’ wins were 1-0s.‘5-4 is a hockey score, not a football one,’ he said at the time. ‘In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4, I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly’.Mourinho once came up with a hilarious metaphor when asked about the importance of having a solid defence: ‘It's like having a blanket that is too small for the bed. You pull the blanket up to keep your chest warm and your feet stick out. I cannot buy a bigger blanket because the supermarket is closed. But I am content because the blanket is cashmere. It is no ordinary blanket.’The way Jose invested in cashmere proved he really adored his defensive style.Set-piece specialist: Sam AllardyceBig Sam was a truly progressive and innovative coach for the Premier League, drawing inspiration from physically-oriented American soccer that developed in the same way that their football worked.Conditioning and ‘moneyball’ methods aside, Allardyce noticed the importance of set pieces and their effectiveness. His Bolton side would later score more than a third of all their goals through dead-ball situations while part of the transfer strategy would be dedicated to finding players who were great in this aspect.The trend of Big Sam’s teams remained intact over time: when he secured Sunderland’s Premier League survival in 2015/16, his side bagged more set-piece goals than any other team while also conceding the fewest.Comeback king: Jurgen Klopp‘WE decide when it’s over. Between 82 and 94 minutes, you can make eight goals if you want! But you have to work for it,’ Klopp said after Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace in November 2015, aiming a dig at the Reds’ fans who left the stadium long before the final whistle.Back then, nobody could imagine Jurgen Klopp’s team would later be called the ‘comeback kings’ and the ‘mentality monsters’ for their ability to turn things around at any point. The 4-0 against Barcelona and the 4-3 against Borussia Dortmund are just the most standout turnarounds among multiple comebacks in the Premier League.There was a feeling Liverpool somewhat lost their comeback ability in Klopp’s worst season at the helm, the 2022/23, but by February 2024 already, his side won as many Premier League points from losing positions as in their title-winning 2019/20 season.What does the future hold for Jurgen Klopp after his Liverpool exit? You may check the latest odds hereFather figure: Sir Alex FergusonOne of the biggest things Sir Alex was renowned for was his ability to develop youngsters, nurturing many into world-class players. Multiple Man United legends have opened up about his role as a mentor and a father figure in their careers as he guided them on and off the pitch.‘For me, Sir Alex Ferguson is like a father in football. He helped me a lot, he taught me many things, and in my opinion, of course he had a big role because of the relationship that we had,’ were the words of Cristiano Ronaldo.David Beckham even called Fergie ‘one of the most important people’ in his life from the age of 12-13: ‘He came to us as a small, skinny little boy you know? But when you see potential it sticks out at you. It's your job then to bring that to fruition, to make them a man.’Ferguson nurtured the entire club, not just those talented teenagers: he oversaw several generations in his 27 years at United and continues to do it now, albeit in a less impactful role.Bargain deals: Arsene WengerThe Frenchman was a master of discovering under-the-radar talents and luring them to Arsenal for bargain fees.Some of the most notable examples of Arsene’s low-cost policy include Robin van Persie (€4.5m), Patrick Vieira (€5.35m), Cesc Fabregas (€3.2m), Kolo Toure (€185k) and Nicolas Anelka (€760k), two of them being crucial parts of the Gunners’ famous Invincible squad. Even Thierry Henry’s €16m signing in 1999 can be considered a low-cost one considering his total impact on the Premier League’s and Arsenal's history.Wenger’s shrewd approach was relevant until his final days at the Emirates as he was never eager to overpay for any player.In-game mimics: Miguel HerreraThe Mexican first made the headlines with his emotional outburst as the manager of Club America, becoming the protagonist of some hilarious memes.Herrera later became the head coach of Mexico’s national team and even led them at the 2014 World Cup. His side scored five goals in four games of the tournament, so he had many reasons to celebrate the way he loves doing it the most."
Could Girona be denied a Champions League spot because of Man City link?,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-26-could-girona-be-denied-a-champions-league-spot-because-of-man-city-link/,,Tribuna.com,2024-01-26T21:45:00.000Z,"Many people wonder if Girona would be allowed to participate in the Champions League amid their strong connection with Manchester City.Everything indicates there will be a way for the La Liga revelation to do it.The City Football Group only own 47 per cent of the shares at Girona. The Catalans' owners also include US-Bolivian businessman Marcelo Claure who owns 35 per cent and the Girona Football Group (Pep Guardiola's brother Pere) who owns another 16 per cent. Pere Guardiola is also chairman of the club's board of directors. Nominally, he is a completely independent person there.On the one hand, Man City own absolutely nothing at Girona – they just have a common owner, the City Football Group, in whose structure they are nominally equivalent. On the other hand, the fact that Red Bull is the owner of both Salzburg and Leipzig forced the company to transfer the rights to the club itself in order to remain its main sponsor.However, Girona have nominally independent managers, and several cases this season (Milan and Toulouse, Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise, Aston Villa and Vitoria) prove that this is enough.All Girona need is to agree to a series of conditions:1. not to transfer any players to Manchester City, neither on permanent deals nor on loan basis, neither directly nor indirectly, until September 2024;2. not to enter into any collaborations, joint technical or commercial agreements;3. not to use a joint scouting or player database.Of course, this does not completely rule out the risk that UEFA will suddenly see Pere Guardiola's connection to Man City or, more generally, the management relationship between the two clubs – but the cases mentioned above confirm that nominal independence is sufficient here."

For those of you're somehow unaware, the Super Bowl is an America's annual NFL bonanza, broadcasted in over 150 countries.

And the Argentine is set to appear in one of those, sharing the screen with Jason Sudeikis, aka Ted Lasso.Anyway, what's so special about? Did he finally break the language barrier and dazzle us with his impeccable English? Spoiler alert: he did not.There's one thing that flew under the radar, though: Messi didn't go for the goal but he went all generous and decided to assist it instead.Have a look.Here's what fans have to say about it:.UMAR: ""Did he just..assist it?

We need to send the first signal that we care, that we want to go to the final. That is not only about playing well... it’s also our attitude and our commitment.“We need to apolo­gise to our fans. I can understand the players and fans. The players were so disappointed [after Middlesbrough defeat]. So upset that you [just] want to go home. But we need to recognise the effort of our fans.""

With Real Madrid still trailing by two goals at half-time, Jude Bellingham approached the referee and firmly stated: ""I was fouled there.""""I agree with you,"" the referee responded.""I don't get a f*cking foul for you agreeing with me though?""""Same shit every week,"" he said in visible frustration before heading to the dressing room.The incident in question involved an Almeria player stepping on Jude's foot, leaving studs marks, yet the referee overlooked it.If this footage proves anything, it's that the refereeing in the Spanish league doesn't actually favour anyone, it's just consistently poor.Real Madrid's biggest strength in Almeria win shown in lineup"

While berating the referee's performance on the night, the analysts on TV went to critically analyze the three penalties Real Madrid were denied in the game. They insisted that two were as clear as day. ""On the possible penalties, two remain for Bellingham. The first was due to a knockdown by Savic when the Englishman was running towards a ball that left him alone in front of Oblak. “There is no need to talk, it is shameful that it is not pointed out. He puts his elbow in his back so that he cannot advance, ignoring the ball. It's like a cathedral, clamorous! A tackle. ""And on the last one, a grab from Llorente at the exit of a corner: To say that 'the two players hug' is to take people for idiots, for stupid, and here we are not stupid. ""They foul him twice in the penalty area and none are awarded. Jude is realizing what the Spanish League is.”Bellingham was clearly fouled on this instance with Savic barging him to the floor.

That means a season starts and you plan pretty much the next season already.“When we sat there together talking about potential signings, the next summer camp and can we go wherever, the thought came up, ‘I am not sure I am here then anymore’ and I was surprised myself by that. I obviously start thinking about it.“It didn’t start [then], but of course last season was kind of a super-difficult season and there were moments when at other clubs probably the decision would have been, ‘Come on, thank you very much for everything but probably we should split here, or end it here.’ That didn’t happen here, obviously.“For me it was super, super, super-important that I can help to bring this team back onto the rails. It was all I was thinking about. When I realised pretty early that happened, it’s a really good team with massive potential and a super age group, super characters and all that, then I could start thinking about myself again and that was the outcome. It is not what I want to [do], it is just what I think is 100 per cent right.”“We will have a moment, maybe the last matchday here or somewhere else – I mean in other countries or other competitions. There’s enough time to do these kinds of things. Let’s now really go for it. The outside world want to use this decision, laugh about it, want to disturb us.“We are Liverpool, we went through harder things together. And you went through harder things before me. Let’s make a strength of it. That would be really cool. Let’s squeeze everything out of this season and have another thing to smile about when we look back in the future.”"

Explaining what happened during those harrowing moments in that first half against Alaves at Camp Nou, Aguero recounted feeling like the walls of life were closing in on him. ""I felt like I was drowning, I didn't feel pain. I had a lot of pressure in my head. I figured it was because I was physically ill and I thought: 'S**t, I'm so bad,"" Aguero said in an interview. ""I jumped for a header. They went to counter and I started to get dizzy. I felt like I was going to faint and I wanted to calm down. ""I wanted to say something and the words didn't come out. I grabbed the hand of the Alaves captain as if to say: 'Stop the game.""When I calmed down, I felt like my heart started beating faster. That's where the arrhythmia attack caught me. A week before it had happened to me in training but it had only been for 20 seconds,"" Aguero said. Aguero got the best treatment for his heart condition but doctors advised him to quit football for good after that. The Argentine striker was unstoppable in the Premier League with Manchester City where he scored 260 goals but he only scored once for Barca after five appearances.

"Xabi Alonso at Bayern: Tactical profile, greatest strengths and potential starting eleven",https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-16-xabi-alonso-at-bayern-tactical-profile-greatest-strengths-and-potential-starting-eleven/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Tribuna,2024-02-16T07:18:56.000Z,"Xabi Alonso is one of the most respected coaches this season. The young coach has almost done the impossible - he has a really good chance of breaking FC Bayern Munich's dominance in the Bundesliga and doing so with Bayer Leverkusen.Although he says he is living a happy life at Leverkusen, Bayern are said to have him firmly on the list of possible successors to Thomas Tuchel.Xabi Alonso is a very flexible coach who has tried out many different formations since taking office. One of his most popular variations is the 3-4-2-1, but he has also played with a 4-3-3 or a classic 4-4-2 several times.Alonso has gotten the best out of his two full-backs and Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong are now dream targets for several top clubs. There's also a lot of quality in the midfield. The move for Granit Xhaka was initially met with scepticism, but now he stands as one of the best in his position. Victor Boniface in attack is also noteworthy, although unfortunately, he is currently injured.Alonso places great emphasis on the midfielders as the main creative force, which is why his team tends to have a lot of possession (57% on average this season). Alongside Xhaka, players like Florian Wirtz, Jonas Hofmann, Exequiel Palacios, and Robert Andrich contribute to the team's midfield strength. Upfront, Alonso prefers a lone striker, a style that's quite characteristic for FC Bayern as well.Let's take a look at the possible lineups.Option 1Neuer - Upamecano, De Ligt, Kim - Mazraoui, Kimmich, Goretzka, Davies - Musiala, Sane - KaneThis is probably the best Bayern team if all players are available now (in a three-man chain).Option 2Neuer - Upamecano, De Ligt, Kim - Mazraoui, Kimmich, Goretzka, Grimaldo - Musiala, Wirtz - KaneWith Xabi Alonso, two FC Bayern targets could move to Munich. Florian Wirtz has long been a target for Munich and it would be interesting to see his duo with Jamal Musiala at Bayern.As for Alex Grimaldo, he is seen as a possible replacement for Alphonso Davies, which wouldn't be a bad option for Beyern either.Potential Bayern XI with Jose Mourinho"

According to Jose Felix of Marca, Los Blancos are interested in his teammate Yan Couto. Couto is admired for his versatility on the right flank. The 21-year-old can play as a right-back, right-midfielder or right-winger. This season, Couto has delivered seven assists in his 21 La Liga appearances. No player has recorded more assists, not even Toni Kroos who has been the league's assists leader for some time. However, Couto has now matched Kroos (7). Marca say Couto will be a low-budget option for Real Madrid as his market value stands at €10m. Even if Girona demands a higher fee considering his outstanding performances this season, Real Madrid would still get him without breaking the bank. Real Madrid have been thinking of an attack-minded right-back who could in future replace Dani Carvajal and Couto seems to check every box. The Brazilian is young, fast, talented and highly creative. If Real Madrid signs Couto, someone like Lucas Vazquez might be allowed to leave. The Spaniard is out of contract in the summer and the club are yet to start renewal talks.

He is expected to take charge at the end of the current season, with Patrick Stewart as acting CEO till then. Berrada boasts an impressive list of qualifications with Manchester City and Barcelona over the years. It's crazy that Man United have even pulled off making an appointment like this. However, Berrada wasn't always a fan of the Red Devils as evidenced by his past tweets. Back in 2013, for example, Berrada posted: ""Watching the Man Utd vs Bayern 1999 UCL final on ESPN Classic. I had forgotten how much Bayern really deserved to win that match."" The following year, he took a shot at Man United's troubles at the time shortly after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. He tweeted: ""Manchester United: How did they get into this mess?"" That's not all - back in 2012, Omar was gleefully cheering on Chelsea in our 3-3 draw. During the game, he said: ""Stuck at the airport 'cause of snow delays. Killing time watching Man United vs Chelsea on my iPad via Sky go. And hoping for a ManU loss...""Incidentally, Fernando Torres scored the second goal for Chelsea. And shortly after, Omar posted again: ""Goal! Chelsea 2-0 Manchester United. Oh yeah! Viva la Spanish Connection!""And in 2012, he took a shot at Man United for losing 3-0 to Newcastle. He tweeted: ""Good timing for Virgin Money to start shirt sponsorship with Newcastle. 3-0 win vs Manchester United."" His personal feelings for Man United aside, Berrada seems like a highly qualified and experienced CEO - which is exactly the need of the hour.

Araujo is still a subject of serious interest from Bayern Munich with the Bavarians having reportedly enquired of the defender's availability back in January. Barca are still pushing to get Frenkie to extend his contract until the summer of 2029 to allow them to amortise his salary but the Dutchman remains adamant about not doing that. It means Barca could also try to sell him to get his insane wage bill off their books. It's not that Barca doesn't appreciate Araujo or De Jong. Sporting director Deco claims he would rather keep them than sign Mbappe. However, Barca are in dire financial straights with FFP and would rather turn to big-player sales to solve the problem.

Xavi's Leaving Barcelona – Is Arteta the Best Option to Replace Him?,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-02-08-xavis-leaving-barcelona-is-arteta-the-best-option-to-replace-him/,Alex,,2024-02-08T10:30:05.000Z,"Hey there football fans! The football world was rocked recently by the news of Xavi Hernandez's departure from Barcelona, leaving fans wondering who will step up to fill his shoes.  With speculation swirling, one name that has emerged as a potential replacement is none other than Mikel Arteta. But is the former Arsenal midfielder the best option to lead Barcelona into a new era? Let's dive in and explore. The Xavi Legacy: A Tough Act to Follow First things first, let's talk about Xavi. As one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Xavi's influence on Barcelona and the game of football as a whole cannot be overstated. With his vision, passing ability, and tactical intelligence, he was the heartbeat of the Barcelona midfield during their golden era, playing a pivotal role in their numerous successes. But with Xavi now departing for new challenges, Barcelona find themselves in need of a manager to lead the team forward. The question is: who can possibly fill the void left by such a legendary figure? Arteta: The Apprentice Becomes the Master? Enter Mikel Arteta. The former Barcelona youth product may not have enjoyed the same level of success as Xavi during his playing career, but he has certainly made a name for himself as a manager. After hanging up his boots, Arteta transitioned into coaching and quickly caught the eye of Arsenal, where he served as Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City. In 2019, Arteta returned to Arsenal as the club's head coach, tasked with reviving a struggling team. While his tenure at Arsenal has had its ups and downs, there's no denying the impact he has had on the team, leading them to FA Cup glory and instilling a more cohesive playing style. The Barcelona Connection: A Return to Roots What makes Arteta such an intriguing candidate for the La Liga Barcelona job is his connection to the club. As a product of La Masia, Barcelona's famed youth academy, Arteta understands the club's ethos and style of play better than most. His time spent under the tutelage of Guardiola at Barcelona and later at Manchester City has also given him invaluable experience and insights into the tactical nuances of the game.  With Barcelona in need of a fresh start and a return to their identity as a possession-based, attacking team, Arteta's footballing philosophy aligns closely with the club's values. His emphasis on tactical discipline, fluid passing, and pressing fits seamlessly with the Barcelona way of playing, making him a natural fit for the job. The Challenges Ahead: A Steep Learning Curve Of course, taking charge of a club of Barcelona's stature comes with its own set of challenges. The expectations are sky-high, and the pressure to deliver immediate results can be overwhelming. Arteta will need to prove himself capable of handling the demands of a top-tier club and navigating the complexities of managing a star-studded squad. Additionally, Arteta's lack of experience as a top-level manager could be cause for concern. While he has shown promise during his time at Arsenal, he is still relatively inexperienced compared to other candidates who may have more extensive managerial resumes. Conclusion In conclusion, while Mikel Arteta may not be the most obvious choice to replace Xavi at Barcelona, he certainly brings a unique set of qualities to the table. His deep understanding of the club's culture, coupled with his tactical acumen and coaching pedigree, make him a compelling option to lead Barcelona into a new era. However, only time will tell whether Arteta is up to the task of filling the shoes of a legend like Xavi and guiding Barcelona back to the summit of football. For now, the footballing world waits with bated breath to see what the future holds for both Xavi and Barcelona, and whether Arteta will indeed be the man to usher in a new era of success at Camp Nou."

""100 per cent focus on that and not thinking about winning the FA Cup at this moment."" Understandably, Ten Hag doesn't wish to tempt fate, especially after losing the FA Cup to Manchester City in the final last season. That, of course, allowed them to complete the treble. However, winning the FA Cup is fans' only source of joy this season. The Red Devils are already out of the League Cup, the Champions League and are 16 points behind leaders Liverpool in the Premier League.

Another figure whom Ineos have a particular liking for is ex-Chelsea manager Graham Potter, who is currently unemployed. For the time being, however, Sir Jim & co are ready to support Ten Hag until the end of the season before deciding who is best suited to lead the Red Devils going forward."

Barcelona prepared to sell Kounde this summer for one reason only – top source,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-14-barcelona-prepared-to-sell-kounde-this-summer-for-one-reason-only-top-source/,Kingsley_,Ferran Martinez,2024-02-14T16:42:43.000Z,"Barcelona are prepared to sell Jules Kounde this summer because they believe they have too many centre-backs at the club, top source Ferran Martinez reports. Barca are counting on defenders like Ronald Araujo, Andreas Christensen, Inigo Martínez, Pau Cubarsí and Eric Garcia who returns from loan in the summer. Added to Kounde and another probable La Masia revelation in Mika Faye, Barca would have seven centre-backs vying for two starting positions in the team. The club calculates they only need two or at most three backups for the starters. Thus, Barca can afford to offload one centre-back in the summer. The player who would fetch the most money from a sale is Araujo with Bayern snooping all over his signature. However, Barca are adamant about not selling the powerful Uruguayan despite his struggles this season. The second defender who would generate the most money from a sale is Kounde and that's why his name has come up. Barca could offer him to clubs around Europe and hope for a favourable bid. Kounde's second season at Barca has not gone as well as he'd have hoped with the Frenchman seemingly becoming error-prone and easy to dribble. However, Barca's defensive unit has been lacklustre all season. Barca assume Jules Kounde could decide to leave in summer (reliability: 4 stars)"

Hojlund was seen as a €60million or €70million player, but the final fee was much closer to €90million.”For the time being, Chelsea have not received a transfer offer for Broja, who is still likely to start up front in the upcoming game against Middlesbrough.Armando Broja position on Chelsea exit revealed (reliability: 3 stars)Chelsea want to sell Broja (reliability: 5 stars)"

Jurgen Klopp has announced his summer exit from Liverpool. The news came as a shock as the German has a contract until 2026.2. The 56-year-old says he's not the one for the future. Among other reasons, he cites fatigue as the key factor.3. Klopp is not sure he'll ever coach another club again. One thing he is sure of is that if he does, it won't be an English club.4. Pep Ljinders leaves, too. In fact, the entire backroom staff go with Klopp.5. Xabi Alonso has spoken out on potentially succeeding Klopp. As an ex-player and already a successful coach, the Bayer Leverkusen boss is hugely popular among Liverpool fans.6. Liverpool could line up in two formations under Alonso. While it's all hypothetical, we've provided insight into Alonso's coaching.7. Bayer's stance on letting Alonso go is known. He doesn't have a release clause, but it seems like he won't be held hostage at his current club.8. Roberto de Zerbi has been asked about the Liverpool job. The Brighton head coach prefers to focus on his team at the moment.9. Bookies have already slashed odds on Klopp's successor. Xabi Alonso, Roberto de Zerbi and even Steven Gerrard are among the favourites.10. Klopp won't advise FSG about his successor. The gaffer says the club don't need advice from 'an old man walking out'.11. FSG aren't the reason Klopp leaves. The German made sure to respond to this suggestion in his press conference.12. Bookies have named seven potential destinations for Klopp. After Jurgen is done with sipping cocktails, he won't have a lack of suitors but some jobs stand out the most.13. Oh, and Klopp's final game as Liverpool's head coach isn't far away. Men, you are officially allowed to cry this May, possibly up to three times as Liverpool are still challenging for three trophies."

Now, Rashford has arrived presumably to discuss the way forward after Erik ten Hag promised to deal with it internally. Meanwhile, according to The Sun, Rashford could be fined £650,000 - about two weeks of his wages - for this latest act of indiscipline.

The Brazilian winger failed to get a shot out before the Newport defenders were able to clear the ball away.

Nowadays everyone knows how the opponent plays, there is so much information that in the end the most important thing, which is the footballer, is controlled by remote control.“ And in our case, I don't know with other teams, you run the risk of losing the essence, of taking away from the player what he has best. If you are constantly telling him what to do, you run that risk. We transmit what is fair, what we believe we have to transmit, what is really important, so as not to overwhelm you with information.“We are losing the essence of football, and not only at the professional level, but at the children's level as well. My children play in Spain and they are overwhelmed with information. They receive the ball and are already being told what to do.“There are no dribblers because if they barely receive the ball you say ‘Pass it!’... Imagine if Messi, when he was eight years old, had been told all the time ""Pass it!"" his coaches, today we wouldn't have him. It's something impressive.“Since football has ended up being such a big thing, everyone reads, studies, and believes that with that they can lead. You tell a 7 or 8 year old child to make a run, to make the coverage... he is seven years old! Let him play ball, make mistakes, and when he is 14 or 15 we start correcting him. It is a message for the future. This is a sport and the beauty of football should not be lost.”Scaloni helped Argentina win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, their first such championship in over 35 years. He also helped them clinch the 2021 Copa America title, which they’ll aim to retain in the upcoming edition starting from June."

However, if you look closely you'd see that a Leipzig player who was offside was challenging Lunin from behind. “The disallowed goal was the correct decision,"" Barcelona icon Thierry Henry explains on CBS Sport.  ""I first thought it was a goal, but on the replay, you can see it is not. As a player, you are told if you are offside don’t get involved.

Unpacking Ronaldo's Pro League prediction: Five reasons why it was incorrect,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-23-unpacking-ronaldos-pro-league-prediction-five-reasons-why-it-was-incorrect/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,SSC Sport,2024-01-23T09:20:14.000Z,"The Saudi Pro League made headlines during the summer transfer window by attracting some of Europe's well-known players. Cristiano Ronaldo, the league's standout figure, had high hopes for more big names joining. Speaking to Saudi broadcaster SSC Sport, Ronaldo said: ""I'm happy because when I made the decision to come here nobody believed what I said.""""But that is the past. It doesn't matter anymore, the most important is that the league has grown and that players want to come because they know the league is competitive and the whole world is watching now.""But things are taking a different turn. Just this month, there are talks about Karim Benzema considering going back to Europe. Surprisingly, Jordan Henderson has left Al Ettifaq, even though he had previously pledged to support the growing league.Aymeric Laporte has also spoken about many players feeling unhappy. You can clearly see some things falling apart in the Saudi Pro League. Here are five reasons why this can be happening. Poor crowdsAlthough it has some superstar players, the Saudi Pro League faces a problem with low attendance when compared to Europe's 'big five leagues.'This season, an average of 8,345 fans attended a Saudi Pro League match, and some games had fewer than 1,000 supporters. For instance, on October 22, Henderson's Al-Ettifaq lost 1-0 to Al-Riyadh in front of only 696 supporters. Many other games during the same weekend also didn't reach the 1,000 attendance mark.Lack of competitivenessIn the summer, Saudi Arabia's public investment fund acquired the nation's top four clubs: Al Nassr, Al Hilal, Al Ittihad, and Al Ahli. Currently, three of these teams hold the top four positions in the season's standings.This takeover has created a noticeable gap between the league's best and worst clubs, and it is expected to widen further. While this lack of competitiveness is a critique faced by many major leagues globally, it poses a particular challenge for a growing division without an established global audience. This aspect might not be an attractive selling point for the leaguePlayers failing to acclimatise properlyJordan Henderson has already left the Saudi Pro League, clearly not finding a comfortable fit in the Gulf state.Aymeric Laporte, in an interview with Spanish newspaper AS, openly acknowledged the challenges of adapting to his new surroundings: ""They have not made it easy for us. In fact, there are many players that are discontented. ""We are working on it every day, negotiating so to speak, and to see if it improves a little because this is something new for them too, having European players who already have a long career. Maybe they are not used to this and have to adapt to a little more seriousness.”Star players failing to make an impactOne striking case is Neymar Jr, who joined Al Hilal in the summer but suffered an ACL and meniscus tear while on international duty with Brazil in October. Unfortunately, this setback is expected to keep the Brazilian star out until the start of the next season.While Ronaldo and Aleksandar Mitrovic have lived up to expectations by scoring a total of 37 goals this season, some of the league's other prominent stars, like Sadio Mane, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino, haven't been as dynamic as they were in the past.Inability to attract players at their peakThe Saudi Pro League has faced challenges in drawing players at their prime. During the summer, most arrivals were renowned players looking to wrap up their careers and earn Gulf state wages in the process.Aymeric Laporte: 'Many footballers are unhappy in Saudi Arabia'"
4 crucial things Sir Jim Ratcliffe already doing differently than Glazers at Man United,https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-27-4-things-sir-jim-ratcliffe-already-doing-differently-than-glazers-at-man-united/,Meghna @ 1819,Tribuna.com,2024-01-27T11:06:00.000Z,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe's decision to purchase a 25% stake in Manchester United was met with negativity at first. As INEOS near Premier League ratification of the minority takeover, there is a sense of optimism at Old Trafford again. Even when not fully in control, Ratcliffe and his team have already set moves in place that show their desire to do things differently than the Glazers. Tribuna.com takes a look at four such vital moves so far. Establishing proper structureFor the first time since the days of David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson, Man United are attempting to establish a proper structure at the very top. INEOS is intent on bringing in experienced and skilled people to make the tough decisions. They have already finalised former Man City executive Omar Berrada to join as the new Chief Executive Officer at the end of this season. Ratcliffe is not hesitant to take inspiration from Man City's structural hierarchy to adopt a similar approach at Man United. Over the years, the Red Devils have not had the right people to make big decisions. However, with the appointment of a sporting director next on Ratcliffe's agenda, that could change soon. Commercial ops & football go hand in handInitially, the Glazers were supposed to oversee commercial operations while Ratcliffe focused only on football matters. That will also change as Ratcliffe and his INEOS team will also have their say in commercial ventures. Commercial success cannot be achieved without football; Man United became an indomitable global brand only after Sir Alex's impeccable work on the field. One cannot exist without the other - and that's why Ratcliffe intends to bring more cohesion into two aspects that are essentially two sides of the same coin. Cultivate football-first attitudeBelieve it or not, Man United are finally moving towards building an environment that puts 'football first'. You'd think that part would be obvious at a football club but, nope. We only have the Glazers to thank for turning Man United into an 'adult version of Disneyland' as Jurgen Klopp put it not-so-kindly. Streamline transfers And finally, all important decisions on transfers will be taken by the new incoming sporting director. Previously, Ed Woodward made most of the decisions - some of which Man United are still paying the price for. The club desperately needs a reliable head to make the hard calls; getting rid of players and, of course, scouting new talents and negotiating good deals. As far as good deals are concerned, incoming CEO Berrada was responsible for Man City's incredible coup for Erling Haaland. They signed him for just £51.2  million and that's nothing short of a steal. These changes are most welcome and they need a proper shake-up from the top. Although they won't guarantee titles or success on the field, it's certainly a step in the right direction."

Although the Belgian initially struggled for minutes, he's proven to be solid whenever given chances this season. As per the BBC, Trossard has been involved in 11 goals in 14 games across competitions. In the Premier League alone, he has four goal involvements - scoring three and assisting one more. That places him second on the list of Arsenal's most productive players, only behind Bukayo Saka (four goals, four assists).

WHAT?!!That was our reaction at Tribuna when we first saw a Liverpool fan nicknamed Wingplay suggesting this on Twitter. However, it makes much more sense after Wingplay's arguments.Firstly, Dom is extremely helpful in defence when he plays in advanced roles, making more tackles and interceptions than most attacking midfielders. He actively helps defending all over the pitch, as the image shows:Ibou Konate is, unfortunately, very injury-prone and the Hungarian can take his position while he's injured. His creativity could help Liverpool when playing out from the back or during counter-attacks as he could set up chances with long-range passes.Would aerial duels be a problem? Hardly so. ""At 1.86m he is firmly above average height,"" Wingplay writes. ""He has a healthy, muscular build with a broad chest and well rounded shoulders. Physical duels shouldn't be too much of a problem for him.""Additionally, it would free up a slot in midfield, allowing Liverpool to play either Elliott or Mac Allister (or Thiago when he's fit) in their preferred position.""In terms of history this wouldn't be the first time such a transition has been made from midfield to CB,"" Wingplay adds. ""Mascherano rounded off his career moving back there for Pep's Barca after making his name as a CM. Henderson did similar in 20/21 for Liverpool.""So here is what Liverpool's XI would look like with Szoboszlai at centre-back.What do you think about this one? Sounds crazy but..."

Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund were backed to develop a partnership by Erik ten Hag recently. And finally, against Wolves, the duo came good by scoring goals and also helping each other. Hojlund was unlucky to have a fine effort ruled offside before half-time. He provided the all-important assist to help Rashford score the goal that would silence his critics. Rashford returned the favour by being involved in the build-up to Hojlund's goal that came later. He released the ball at the right time for Luke Shaw to get on it and supply the cross that eventually assisted Hojlund's goal.

The French World Cup winner has refused to extend his stay in Paris and wishes to leave in search of a new challenge.

The decision was criticised by Gary Neville and several others, who believed the timing was just not right. Based on information in the documents submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ratcliffe's takeover was on the brink of collapsing. Man United were first put up for sale a year ago but the takeover process was then met with several delays. On December 22, Ratcliffe sent an ultimatum to the Glazers that he's 'not prepared to accept any other changes proposed'. That prompted an emergency board meeting at Man United on - you guessed it - Christmas Eve. And since Sheikh Jassim was already out of the deal at the time, the club hierarchy desperately scrambled to accept Sir Jim's offer. That explains the sudden announcement on Christmas Eve - had they delayed even by another day, Ratcliffe wouldn't have agreed to the takeover."

Klopp uses a 4-3-3 shape with Trent moving from right-back to the midfield when the Reds are in possession.If Alonso persists with a three-at-the-back shape, there will be a need to sign at least two players. Here is what the team would look like with the current players.Liverpool do not have sufficient depth in defence to play 3-4-2-1. Quansah is an option, Sepp van den Berg might stay at Anfield after returning from a Mainz loan but the Reds would still need to sign at least two centre-backs. Otherwise the ironic suggestion of playing Szoboszlai at centre-back could become reality in case of an injury emergency.There is also a pressing issue of Mo Salah, who is consistently linked with a move to Saudi Arabia. He may stay this summer but the Reds will have to think about a replacement — and getting one in 2024 would be a good idea even if Mo stays for another year.So the Reds will need at least three players to play Alonso's 3-4-2-1 shape: two centre-backs and a forward who would replace Mo Salah in the long run."

Carlo Ancelotti was forced to make an early change to his starting XI with Vinicius suffering an injury in the warmup. Carletto smartly chose Brahim Diaz who could offer more defensively than Joselu. The younger Spaniard repaid the faith by bagging a first-half goal. Unfortunately, Real Madrid failed to extend their lead, no thanks to some horrendous refereeing. But Los Blancos shot themselves in the foot late into the game through Ancelotti's substitutions and their erratic defending. The boss subbed off Brahim for Joselu after 71 minutes and that decision allowed Atleti to get out more frequently and attack Real Madrid with Brahim no longer there to terrorize their defence. ""Atleti will be more than happy to see the back of Diaz,"" La Liga TV said upon Brahim's substitution. Perhaps a worse decision than removing Brahim was taking off Jude Bellingham for Dani Ceballos with 2 minutes of normal time to go. The Englishman had drifted to the left side of Madrid's midfield/attack and had Atleti penned in. We could've easily closed the game without any incident if the powerful midfielder had stayed on the pitch. Meanwhile, Ceballos did practically nothing of note after being given the huge responsibility. Real Madrid finally caved in when Nacho and Dani Carvajal miscommunicated allowing Llorente to score an easy header. There's a notion that with Nacho at the heart of Madrid's defence, the Whites are guaranteed to concede at least one goal. It's happened in 7 of the last 8 games now, including the Atleti match. Here's a lineup that unveils Real's biggest weakness in their derby draw. It features Ancelotti for his tactical howler:"

However, the opportunity to extend his career at the top level was too tempting to resist.During his time at City, Lampard got to know David Silva, and there was one particular aspect that caught him off guard.""David was quiet around the place but what an incredible player,"" he said to Mancity.com. ""I noticed it first in training and he was of the highest, highest level. He was right up there.

Ben Mee later put the Bees in the lead, but Chris Wood equalized. In the end, Neal Maupay scored the decisive goal, securing a crucial win for Brentford.Despite the success, Toney's goal sparked some controversy. The 27-year-old moved the ball twice while Forest was setting up their wall and cleverly directed a shot through a gap between the wall and the post. He even adjusted some foam from the referee's spray.The Forest manager, Nuno Espirito Santo, questioned VAR's decision to let Toney's free-kick stand: ""It was ball displacement. The law is clear, every goal must be checked and every situation that leads to a goal must be checked.""But Dale Johnson, a VAR expert at ESPN, clarified that overturning the goal wasn't within VAR's authority. He mentioned on Twitter: ""Restarts aren't in VAR's remit.""The phrase ""restarts aren't in VAR's remit"" means that the VAR system is not responsible for making decisions related to restarting the game, such as awarding a corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in. The VAR's main role is to assist the on-field referee in making decisions on goals, penalty kicks, straight red card incidents, and mistaken identity in relation to these incidents.After the game, Toney defended his goal saying: ""You can move it half a yard either side. If I'd missed nobody would really question it, but the fact it's gone in everyone wants to make a noise. But it's gone in the back of the net and we've won the game.""'I didn’t watch football for a while': Ivan Toney reveals he lost passion for the game during his ban"

Speaking about the Barca boss’ recent comments, the outlet’s TV director said: “It’s curious that Xavi finds strange things that happen in La Liga & it seems normal to him that practically during his entire career, for 20 years, his club has been paying the vice president of the referees around €8 million.“I insist, during Xavi’s entire career. For 20 years. That is a total, we have counted, of 600 games in the career of Mr. Xavi Hernandez as a player of Barcelona, with their corresponding titles.“We do not say it, the judge says it, the prosecutor, the Civil guard... Those 600 matches are under suspicion. It’s the reality. Your club is under indictment. The whole period in which Xavi was a player of FC Barcelona is being investigated.”This is a dig at the ‘Case Negreira’, with Barca under investigation for allegedly paying the high-ranking referee from 2016-2018. It’s quite obvious that Real Madrid wants Barca to be found guilty in this case and be penalized, something that can help them.Thanks to their controversial win over Almeria, Real Madrid are able to maintain their seven-point lead over Barca in the La Liga standings.Laporta: 'What happened at Bernabeu is a disgrace''Nobody talks': Xavi counts how many points Barca have lost to bad refereeing decisions"

Berrada was responsible for Manchester City's stunning £51.2 million coup of Erling Haaland, even though the player could have easily been sold for double that price. Although Berrada won't take charge of Man United until the end of this season, his thoughts on transfers have excited fans. The Red Devils have been notorious for overspending on players; particularly the likes of Jadon Sancho and Antony, to name a few recently. Quoted by Fabrizio Romano, Berrada said in an interview: ""You need a very solid rationale as to why you’re offering the fee, the salary and commission. ""Once you start overpaying, you lose that argument and that puts you in a much more difficult position for the next one."" After years of overpaying for players who probably didn't deserve those fees, it's refreshing to see Berrada's stance on this matter.

He is obviously getting his games in behind the scenes, behind closed doors.""Brentford are a wonderful club.

Potential Bayern XI with Jose Mourinho,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-15-potential-bayern-xi-with-jose-mourinho/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Tribuna.com,2024-02-15T11:01:44.000Z,"With Bayern now five points behind undefeated Leverkusen in the Bundesliga and already out of the DFB-Pokal, Tuchel's job at the German club appears to be more at risk than ever. Harry Kane is probably already waiting for his former boss Jose Mourinho, who wants to take charge of Bayern and even started to learn German for this occasion. Bayern are unlikely to be short on elite coaches if Tuchel is dismissed, so it could be any boss. However, let's have a look at the potential Bayern XI with Jose Mourinho. It deserves your attention because it is an interesting one.Jose Mourinho used a 3-5-2 formation at Roma and he will probably use it in Bayern if he actually joins. In defence, the formation easily transforms to 5-3-2 due to the hard-working Mazraoui and lightning-fast Davies. As for the CM positions, Goretzka and Kimmich pair makes sense with the latter being one of Mourinho's most favourite players. ""I see him as a top right-back, left-back, centre-back, No.6, No.8, No.10... he has qualities to be anything,"" Mourinho told DAZN about Kimmich. ""He's intelligent and understands what he has to do here and what he has to do there. I think he's phenomenal - absolutely phenomenal player.""The player for the AM role will be chosen between Musiala and Muller. Starboy Jamal is clearly ahead of Muller in skills like dribbling and passing. However, Mourinho likes senior players, so Muller's experience could be crucial for the AM position.There is no need to explain why Kane would be the striker in Mourinho's XI. As for the second attacker, it has to be Sane due to him playing one of the best seasons in his career. He has to be in starting XI being a key player for Bayern right now. As for the central defenders' role, Dier's name can stand out to someone. However, him being in the starting lineup completely makes sense. Dier speaks fluent Portuguese, and Mourinho tends to switch to Portuguese when vocabulary fails him in a foreign tongue, so Dier could conduct Jose's ideas.The second reason is a serious one: Dier would play on the right side, closest to the toilets in Allianz Arena. Mourinho definitely remembers the moment when 'nature was calling' for Eric during the Spurs match.Only stars: Starting XI of players with contracts expiring in 2025"

Martial has not been deemed fit to train with the rest of his teammates owing to his poor form. Everyone knows Erik ten Hag demands the highest standards during training and it's no surprise they haven't been met by the striker. The report further adds that asking Martial to train separately is not due to a disciplinary issue; it's simply that he's not at the level required.

Arsene Wenger's Era: A Revolution in Football,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-17-arsene-wengers-era-a-revolution-in-football/,Alex,,2024-01-17T21:53:57.000Z,"Arsene Wenger, a name synonymous with revolutionizing Arsenal Football Club, brought a wave of change that was initially met with skepticism. Critics labeled him Comical Wenger, before the 2003/04 season, when he said that Arsenal could finish the season without any defeat, unaware of the impact he would have. Under Wenger, Arsenal transformed, embracing innovative tactics and achieving remarkable success. Notably, his tenure shifted the club's perception and expectations significantly. Football enthusiasts, especially followers of live odds, saw a dramatic alteration in Arsenal's prospects, both domestically and internationally.  Revolutionary Tactics and Training Wenger was a pioneer in football tactics and training. He introduced dietary changes and advanced training methods, profoundly influencing players' performances. Wenger's tactics were evident in matches and seasons, where Arsenal's gameplay stood out. Key players, like Thierry Henry and Robert Pires, developed under his guidance, going on to become legends of the game. Wenger’s strategic formations and player signings redefined Arsenal's approach to the game.  He emphasized fluid passing and maintaining possession, a stark contrast to the then-prevalent direct style of English football. His focus on developing young talents, like Cesc Fàbregas, and connecting them with experienced players, created a dynamic and strong team. Wenger's Arsenal became known for their attractive, attacking play, setting a new paradigm in the league. The Invincibles and Trophy Success The 2003/04 season, known as The Invincibles season, remains a high point in Wenger's career. This unbeaten season was proof of his strategic masterpiece. Key players, including Henry, Vieira, and Bergkamp, were the most important parts of this success. Wenger's approach not only brought consistent trophy wins but also elevated Arsenal's status in the Premier League and Europe.  In the Invincibles season, memorable Premier League matches were a thrilling 2-2 draw against Manchester United and a decisive 4-2 victory over Liverpool. Arsenal's campaign ended with 26 wins, 12 draws, and zero defeats, standing as a proof of Wenger's tactical expertise. Their dominance in these key fixtures was crucial in crafting an unbeaten league season, a rare feat in football history. Arsenal were unbeaten for 49 games in a row. The Emirates Stadium - Vision and Legacy Wenger's vision extended beyond the pitch. His ideas and plans led to the construction of the Emirates Stadium. This strategic move was aimed at ensuring the club's future growth and financial stability. Despite the challenges of transitioning to a new stadium, Wenger adeptly managed the team. This period was challenging, yet Wenger's leadership and foresight ensured that Arsenal remained competitive while laying a foundation for the future. Wenger's role in the Emirates had many ups and downs, and it involved balancing budget constraints while maintaining team performance. He navigated this period by selling key players like Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas, compensating for limited spending. His adaptability in building competitive teams, despite financial limitations, showcased his managerial prowess and commitment to Arsenal's long-term success and stability."

He scored a wonderful goal and was always up to create something, keeping the opposition defenders on their toes.Nkunku looked like the spark in this Chelsea side — and that spark was really bright. If he stays fit, the team's fortunes will certainly improve.2. Creativity. Chelsea missed several but it means that they created them in the first place. Coming to a place like Anfield and actually standing a chance of getting something means a lot.The Blues do need to work on how clinical they are in front of goal. But it will come one day.3. Chukwuemeka. Pochettino's substitutions yesterday didn't really work with the exception of one. Carney came on in the 66th minute and added a sense of solidity and calmness to Chelsea's midfield.The Englishman is gradually getting back from a knee injury sustained back in August and it's great to see that he's a huge asset."

""It’s a massive win for us. We’ve got closer and that was the aim for today. It was absolutely our target and we did it.""I think also the way we did it, I liked it. Of course, I liked especially the first 20 minutes when we were dictating the game.""After, I think we were dropping a little bit too much. ""We had our moments in the counterattacks, but to fight back from 1-1 [makes us] really happy for today."" The Red Devils pulled off yet another big win against fourth-placed Villa to reduce the gap to just five points in the table. Man United got ahead via a goal from Rasmus Hojlund, his fifth in as many consecutive games. Douglas Luiz equalised for the hosts after the break but the moment didn't last long, thanks to Scott McTominay - or Man United's latest super-sub. Ten Hag has plenty to be grateful for; he's made a strong statement of intent with his strongest players available.

Top 5 most likely candidates to succeed Xavi at Barca,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-27-top-5-most-likely-candidates-to-succeed-xavi-at-barca/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-01-27T21:36:56.000Z,"Here are the managers who have a good chance of succeeding Xavi at Barcelona this summer.1. Thiago MottaThe former Barca man is said to be Deco's favourite who is also liked by Joan Laporta. He is currently doing a great job with Serie A side Bologna who are just 3 points behind the Champions League spot at the moment.2. Rafa MarquezThe Barca Atletic boss was initially targeted as an interim coach in case Xavi left the club during the season. However, he might also take up the permanent head coach role as he's admired by Laporta.3. Roberto De ZerbiThe Brighton boss was tipped to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City one day, but the Barca situation opens up a new opportunity for him. His possession-based style of play would be a big bonus.4. Julian NagelsmannThe German is also said to be among Laporta's favourite options. If things go wrong for Germany's national team at the Euros or the 36-year-old simply decides to leave, he would be a tidbit for the board.5. Antonio ConteThe Italian is known for his demanding nature and strictness, but he also knows how to build a team of champions, even if in the short term.The other possible options include:- Erik ten Hag;- Hans-Dieter Flick;- Xabi Alonso;- Mikel Arteta."
How Real Madrid can lineup with Mbappe next season – they won Champions League with this formation,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-15-how-real-madrid-can-lineup-with-mbappe-next-season-they-won-champions-league-with-this-fo/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-02-15T20:44:02.000Z,"Multiple credible sources claim that Kylian Mbappe will be a Real Madrid player later this year. The Frenchman has reportedly taken the biggest step towards Madrid by telling PSG he wants to leave. One big question that would be on everyone's mind is, how best Mbappe would fit in at the current Real Madrid squad. The answer is simple — 4-3-3. Real Madrid were lining up in the 4-3-3 formation when they won the Champions League and La Liga in 2022. They were doing it under the same manager — Carlo Ancelotti. To accommodate Mbappe, Ancelotti simply needs to revert to his 4-3-3 system that had Karim Benzema spearheading the attack and winning the Ballon d'Or at the end of that season. Mbappe is not a typical number 9 who stays up front waiting for opportunities. Like Benzema, Mbappe likes to drift deep and into the wide areas to receive the ball and affect the game. Vinicius formed a deadly partnership with Benzema playing that way and will likely do so again with Mbappe.On the right-wing, Rodrygo will hold his own, forming a devastating front-three of Vini-Mbappe-Rodrygo. Jude Bellingham will likely drop deeper with Mbappe arriving. The midfielder has been Real's top scorer this season but that's the job of a striker. Finally, with Mbappe's arrival bringing an end to a four-man midfield, Camavinga might have a reduced role.Here's the best lineup that accommodates Mbappe at Real Madrid: Real Madrid reach agreeement to sign Mbappe (reliability: 5 stars)"
Luka Modric 'worried' about Real Madrid future as Ceballos overtakes him in pecking order,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-30-luka-modric-worried-about-real-madrid-future-as-ceballos-overtakes-him-in-pecking-order/,Kingsley_,Diario AS,2024-01-30T07:43:17.000Z,"Luka Modric has grown ever so worried about his Real Madrid future in the aftermath of Carlo Ancelotti promoting Dani Ceballos ahead of him in the midfield pecking order, per Sergio Lopez of Diario AS.It happened in Real Madrid's last game against Las Palmas where Ancelotti decided to deploy Ceballos ahead of Modric in his heavily-rotated starting XI. Modric didn't come off the bench for the entire game and it was the fifth time that has happened this season. Modric has played just 42% of the available minutes at Real Madrid this season, putting him 15th on the list of players with the most minutes at the club this term. He's played just 50 minutes more than Andriy Lunin. However, the Croatian legend has performed well when given the chance. Of the 24 games he's played this term he's contributed six assists and scored once. Still, Ancelotti doesn't see him as part of his best XI.  Modric is out of contract in June and his limited playing minutes will certainly impact the club's decision to extend his deal or let him go. In September Modric will turn 39. The veteran midfielder has spent 12 years at Real Madrid winning every possible trophy with the club. Perhaps this is his final rodeo in White.

""Mason [Mount] and Tyrell [Malacia] will take some more weeks. ""He had setbacks during his rehab process, it takes too long, it’s bad for him, bad for us. ""But now we turned a point and it’s positive and he will return soon on the pitch. It won’t take long before he’s returning in team training."" The Red Devils are hit by yet another defensive crisis ahead of facing Luton Town; if Shaw is deemed unfit, they will only have Diogo Dalot as the only fit senior full-back. Malacia and Shaw were brought in to provide cover and compete with each other but that's not been possible, with both spending most of their time on the treatment table. As for Wan-Bissaka, it looks like time is running out for him to well and truly stake a place in Ten Hag's squad."
A Comprehensive Guide to the Latest Football Tactics: Drawing Parallels with Poker Strategies,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-22-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-latest-football-tactics-drawing-parallels-with-poker-strateg/,Alex,,2024-01-22T18:15:45.000Z,"The world of football is constantly changing, with teams always looking for new strategies to stay ahead of the competition. Interestingly, there are similarities between football tactics and the strategic gameplay of live casino games, particularly poker. In this guide, we will explore the latest trends in football tactics and how they share common ground with the strategic manoeuvres used in the high-stakes poker world. Evolution of Football Tactics Modern football has shifted from traditional formations and playing styles to a more dynamic and flexible approach. Coaches now focus on exploiting the opponent's weaknesses, with tactics evolving throughout a match. High-pressing, possession-based football and fluid formations are among the latest trends. These strategies aim to control the game's tempo and exploit spaces in the opponent's defence. Similarly, in poker, players constantly adapt their strategies based on the game's dynamics. Much like football teams adjusting their tactics during a match, poker players must be observant and responsive to the changing landscape of the table. The ability to read opponents, analyse betting patterns, and adjust one's play accordingly is crucial in both poker and football. High Pressing in Football and Aggressive Play in Poker High pressing has become a hallmark of many successful football teams. It involves putting intense pressure on the opponent in their defensive third, aiming to win back possession quickly. This strategy disrupts the opponent's build-up play and creates scoring opportunities. In poker, an analogous approach is observed through aggressive play. Aggressive poker players frequently raise and re-raise to apply pressure to their opponents. This strategy aims to force opponents to make mistakes, just as high pressure in football pushes the opposing team into errors. Both high pressing in football and aggressive play in poker require a fine balance between calculated risk-taking and strategic execution. Possession-Based Football and Patient Poker Play Possession-based football focuses on maintaining control of the ball and patiently waiting for opportunities to present themselves. Teams employing this strategy are often adept at keeping possession, waiting for the right moment to launch an attack. In poker, a patient and selective playing style mirrors possession-based football. Skilled poker players exercise discipline, folding marginal hands and biding their time for premium opportunities. Possession-based football and patient poker play require a keen understanding of when to be assertive and exercise caution. Fluid Formations and Adaptable Poker Strategies Modern football teams often employ fluid formations that can seamlessly transition from defence to attack. This adaptability keeps opponents guessing and allows for quick transitions between different phases of play. In poker, adaptability is also key. Successful players adjust their strategies based on their opponents' playing styles, stack sizes, and table dynamics. Just as a football team might shift from a defensive formation to an attacking one, poker players must be capable of changing their approach to stay ahead in the game. Conclusion Football tactics and poker strategies may seem worlds apart, but a closer look reveals intriguing parallels. Both realms require a blend of skill, strategy, and adaptability. As football tactics continue to evolve, drawing inspiration from the dynamic world of poker can provide coaches and players with fresh perspectives on approaching the beautiful game. Whether it's high-pressing and aggressive play or possession-based football and patient poker strategies, the common thread lies in the need for astute decision-making and the ability to read and respond to the ever-changing landscape. The synergy between these seemingly disparate worlds highlights the depth and complexity inherent in both football and poker."
'The patellar tendon': Mourinho on Ronaldo's injuries and how good he could be without them,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-16-the-patellar-tendon-mourinho-on-ronaldos-injuries-and-how-good-he-could-be-without-them/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Rio Ferdinand Presents Five,2024-02-16T09:33:25.000Z,"The year 2000 marked a heartbreaking moment in football history when Ronaldo Nazario, fondly known as 'El Fenomeno,' suffered a devastating knee injury that altered the course of his career.In a Coppa Italia match between Inter Milan and Lazio, Ronaldo, making a comeback after a five-month lay-off due to a previous knee injury, attempted one of his trademark runs. A stepover during the dribble led to a collapse on the turf in excruciating pain. This injury turned out to be severe, completely tearing his kneecap tendon.The sight of Inter and Lazio players rushing to Ronaldo's aid and the entire Stadio Olimpico rising in applause as he was stretchered off, head in hands, remains etched in football memory. The Ballon d'Or winner's career took an unfortunate turn that day, underscoring the fragility of even the most exceptional talents in the beautiful game.On the question 'Whether Ronaldo could have been better without injuries', Mourinho answered 'Yes', however he also added that the Brazilian didn't like to train. Mourinho said on Rio Ferdinad's podcast: ""He goes to Inter and in Inter he had immediately the patellar tendon. But what I saw there - crazy! Without training.""""What do you mean?"", Ferdinand asked.""Ah, lazy... Lazy. Training - enjoying, but not training like a method, like discipline. Just enjoying, just the Brazilian boy coming from the beach or coming from his local just to play football, amazing. Such a beautiful thing to see."" So, it seems like Ronaldo Nazario would have been better without injuries as Jose said, however, he wouldn't achieve the level of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo due to his mentality and laziness.'Who won it?': Jose Mourinho explains why Wesley Sneijder wasn't robbed in 2010 Ballon d'Or race"

However, a good outing at the League Two side could be the first step for Bayındır to displace the Cameroonian as number 1. Here's why he seems ready. Bayindir has been in this sort of position before. At the age of 20, he moved from third-choice to top for the Turkish Super Lig side Ankaragucu.“Altay was a young boy, mostly a line goalkeeper, who had great reflexes and was good with his feet,” says Bayindir’s former teammate Ankaragucu teammate Mostafa El Kabir.“When the first goalkeeper got injured, the second choice got one game and didn’t do well. I told the coach, because I had some influence as one of the main players in the team, to play Altay because he was performing very well in training, making good saves, being vocal at such a young age.”Bayindir kept his place for the remainder of the campaign, earning a move in the summer of 2019 to Fenerbahce, where he immediately became a regular.Bayindir has been working hard and patiently waiting for this moment. Since he arrived at United, he has hired a dietitian, a physical therapist, and a performance coach, and the staff says the results are evident. He spends a lot of time talking about sleep and nutrition with the club's specialists.Finally, during his four seasons at Fenerbahce, Bayindir took English lessons three times a week and he wants to learn Dutch and Spanish. Since joining United, he has continued English lessons. He is now fluent and has been known to rib his teammates and staff in a Mancunian accent.'You have an intelligent goalie': Fenerbahce fans detail what Bayindir could bring to Man United"

Al-Khelaifi told reporters at a UEFA Congress: ""It's too easy to say now that the stadium is not for sale anymore. We know what we want, we wasted years to try and buy it. It's easier for us now, we know what we want. It's over for us. We want to move out of the Parc."" This decision comes as the French football giants face the impending departure of Kylian Mbappe, who is expected to join Real Madrid when his contract expires in the summer.The move follows PSG's commitment last year to explore alternatives after Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo made it clear that the Parc des Princes was not available for sale. City Hall reconfirmed this position on Tuesday, leading to PSG's decision to find a new home for their football endeavors.Pierre Rabadan said: ""A sale is not desirable, because that would be a decision with no turning back... That's why we have to rule out the sale of the Parc today. We don't want to sell off Paris' legacy.""Since 1974, the Parc des Princes has been PSG's home, just four years after the club's founding. Despite the desire of the club, owned by wealthy Qatari backer QSI, to stay and own the stadium, they'll have to explore other options. After eight years of discussions, the Paris city council recently voted to confirm that the Parc des Princes will not be sold.Brest player smiles after a horrible tackle on Mbappe"

After the weekend’s games, the ex-Man United captain said on his podcast: “I’m really interested in them (Arsenal) because I think they are the team which are closest to City.“Liverpool are right up there and they have a great manager but I think Arsenal, when I watch them, I feel they are the better team.“That’s not to say they will go on and win the league or finish above Liverpool but I think they have got it within themselves.”Neville has been a cheerleader for Arsenal all through the 2023/24 season and it’s obvious that he wants the Gunners to win the Premier League title over Liverpool.Despite the recent loss at the Emirates Stadium, the fact of the matter is that Liverpool are still ahead of Arsenal in the title race and Jurgen Klopp’s squad definitely has more experience of actually going onto win a Premier League title race – which Arteta’s side famously bottled last season.'Such a sensitive mob': Gary Neville hits back at Liverpool fans angry over title claim'Would swap midfield for United's': looking back at Gary Neville pre-season Liverpool claim that comes back to bite him"

Fortunately, Man United scored two more goals in the end to make it 4-2 but ideally, they could have won with a clean sheet. Throughout the game, one player frustrated fans and Rasmus Hojlund, in particular. Yep, it's Alejandro Garnacho, who had a game to forget against a weaker opponent. Garnacho had plenty of chances to score but he failed to convert any of those into goals. He also failed to set up an easy goal for Hojlund, who was visibly furious with the teenager. On more occasions than one, Garnacho failed to create chances. When Hojlund was unmarked on one wing, the ball was passed either to the opposite or to Antony, who had opponents around him. Hojlund was able to finally get on the scoresheet toward the end of the game. As for Garnacho, well, he has his work cut out for him.

The final verdict is yet to be made, though.Barcelona are being accused of favourable treatment from referees for 17 years. The club had been giving money to former vice-president of the Spanish Referee Committee Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira.

Rudiger recovers from injury – Real Madrid centre-back pair for Girona game revealed,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-09-rudiger-recovers-from-injury-real-madrid-centreback-pair-for-girona-game-revealed/,Kingsley_,Marca,2024-02-09T07:49:54.000Z,"Antonio Rudiger has shaken off the injury he picked up while playing for Real Madrid in the game against Getafe last week, reports say. The German powerhouse will partner with Aurelien Tchouameni in the clash against Girona this weekend, reports Marca's Jose Felix. Rudiger's recovery comes as a massive boost for Real Madrid given the injury crisis the team have been enduring, particularly in defence. Madrid captain Nacho is unlikely to return to full fitness before the Girona game. However, some sources expect him to make the bench for that game provided he completes Real Madrid's Friday training. Real Madrid are expecting to have Eder Militao back for the Champions League round of 16 second-leg. His return would seriously lift morale in Madrid's defence.

"Premier League manager advancing to become Barca's next coach, not Arteta or Klopp (reliability: 4 stars)",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-30-premier-league-manager-advancing-to-become-barcas-next-coach-not-arteta-or-klopp-reliabil/,Kingsley_,Marca,2024-01-30T09:43:28.000Z,"With Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta out of the race to become Barca's next coach, Roberto De Zerbi is now advancing to take the top job, Marca say. The Brighton boss impresses decision-makers at Barca with his style of play and football IQ as shown in the Premier League for one-and-a-half seasons now. Brighton and Barcelona already established a relationship when Ansu Fati was sent there on loan for the season during the summer. Barca allowed the talented youngster to join De Zerbi's team after studying the coach's style of play and ability to bring the best out of young players. De Zerbi guided Brighton to a sixth-place finish in the Premier League last season. A historic achievement for the club. This term, De Zerbi's Brighton are still performing well by their standards as they sit seventh in the Premier League. But their biggest achievement this term is reaching the round of 16 of the Europa League. Brighton have never achieved that feat in their history. While De Zerbi is hailed as an ingenious tactician, the 44-year-old Italian has never managed a big club having coached Benevento, Sassuolo and Shakhtar Donetsk before Brighton. If Barcelona go in for De Zerbi it would be difficult for him to say no considering the job would be the biggest leap of his career yet.

Barca's biggest weakness in Athletic Club defeat shown – it has to do with Yamal,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-25-barcas-biggest-weakness-in-athletic-club-defeat-shown-it-has-to-do-with-yamal/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-01-25T17:32:53.000Z,"Barcelona's team performance against Athletic Club was unimpressive on many levels. The attack wasn't fluid and clinical enough, the midfield lacked creativity while the defensive structure was simply terrible once again.One of the things that hurt Blaugrana the most in the Copa del Rey quarterfinal was Jules Kounde's poor communication with Lamine Yamal on the right side.Even though the two eventually linked up for a goal, they poorly understood each other throughout the game. The best example is Lamine's misplaced pass in the first minute that led to Nico Williams' interception and Gorka Guruzeta's shocking opener.Things slightly improved afterwards, but there was still a lack of proper connection on that right wing – partly because the two were covering almost the same areas.Some fans were losing patience with Kounde who kept on making forward runs despite Yamal's presence.💭 EiF: ""Jules Kounde needs to realise what he is. You're a centre-back playing at right-back. Lamine Yamal is wide open. Pass him the ball. Stop getting cute. Let him do the work, you provide support.""How can the problem be fixed? There are at least three options.1. Ask Kounde to play a less attacking role in possession and make Yamal a wide midfielder who would receive the ball in deeper positions. This way, the gap between the two players would be bigger and the teenager would have more freedom of action. Lamine is great at beating opponents 1-v-1 and passing the ball in central areas, so he could do the job well.2. Use a natural right-back instead of Kounde. Joao Cancelo or Hector Fort would probably have better connection with Yamal as the ones who play on the wing for many years already.3. Improve the understanding by playing them together more often. Yamal has been a starter alongside Kounde on just 9 occasions so far, and most of the time, it was when Jules played at centre-back, so it's obvious their connection isn't perfect."

Moyes is no stranger to the Theatre of Dreams, having managed the club for a brief period after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Speaking after the final whistle, a grumpy Moyes told reporters: ""No I don't think the scoreline was correct. ""Our [West Ham's] performance was better.""I am pleased with that but obviously not pleased with different aspects, we didn't finish chances. ""Overall we played better and our performance was better today."" Rasmus Hojlund scored Man United's first followed by a solid brace from Alejandro Garnacho. Although West Ham made attempts to score, few were blocked by Andre Onana while the rest did not get close to the target. Moyes seems understandably frustrated about falling two points behind Man United in seventh place in the Premier League standings."

He even wished to 'play through the pain', but Arsenal's medical staff advised him against it. The injury seems to have been minor, with The Metro now reporting the midfielder is in line to return when the Gunners face Burnley this weekend.

How Barca can lineup with Mikel Arteta — 2 options,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-29-how-barca-can-lineup-with-mikel-arteta-2-options/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-01-29T11:10:00.000Z,"Mikel Arteta has emerged as an option for Barcelona with the Spanish tactician reportedly disclosing his desire to leave Arsenal at the end of the season.  If Arteta ends up at Barcelona in June as Xavi's replacement, Barca fans can expect a manager who plays attacking football and knows how to bring the best out of his players. We've seen that with the likes of Martinelli, Saka, Odegaard and Saliba. Indeed, Arteta hasn't done badly in his first job at the highest level, winning three trophies in four years. Now let's look at two ways the 41-year-old is likely to set up his Barca team.Option 1. 4-3-3The 4-3-3 is Arteta's preferred formation. He used it for every Premier League match Arsenal has played this season. Arteta's idea is to use a left-footed winger on the right and a right-footed winger on the left. That allows them to cut in and shoot with their stronger foot or invert into the central areas to create an overload. Hence, players like Raphinha and Ansu Fati (when he returns from loan) will get a lot of game time. Arteta is expected to give more minutes to Vitor Roque than Xavi has. That's because Mikel prefers a workaholic number 9 to a static one, an example being Gabriel Jesus - who's also Brazilian like Roque. In midfield, Arteta will appreciate players like Gavi and De Jong who work extremely hard for the team. A creator like Pedri will serve as Arteta's Martin Odegaard. If Barca doesn't sign a new defender, Arteta's defence will be no different from the one Xavi used to win the league last season. Take a look:Option 2. 4-2-3-1Arteta doesn't shy away from tweaking his formation depending on the opposition. We've seen him use the 4-2-3-1 formation in the Champions League this season and in some games last term. This system will allow the new Barca boss to feature some special players like Ilkay Gundogan pairing with De Jong to form a solid midfield base. Lamine Yamal will also get a chance to figure on the right wing with Ferran Torres operating from the opposite flank. Here's option 2:"
"One world-class, 2 yet to prove themselves: Barca La Masia products ranked",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-26-one-worldclass-2-yet-to-prove-themselves-barca-la-masia-products-ranked/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-01-26T13:50:00.000Z,"Barcelona say their La Masia Academy is the best in the world and it's hard to debate against that. How else would you describe a football Academy that produced Leo Messi, Xavi, Iniesta Busquets and other legendary footballers? But all that is in the past. The question is, has La Masia produced players who are helping Barca achieve their sporting objectives? Your answer is as good as mine. Now let's rank Barca's La Masia products currently doing it at the highest level for the first team. World class. The only La Masia product in this category is Gavi. He's a starter not just for Barca but for the national team too. It's hard to think of any club in the world where Gavi wouldn't start and play regularly. Starting XI: Besides Gavi, who's a world-class player, the one La Masia graduate who regularly starts for Barca is Alejandro Balde. Too bad he's injured now. But many top teams will take Balde without blinking. Next big thing: We've all been treated to the magic that's Lamine Yamal but we can agree he's not the finished article yet. His misses against Bilbao tell the tale, and we've seen this before with Ansu Fati. Meanwhile, Pau Cubarsi is reportedly tipped to become the future of Spain's defence. We can only wait to find out but these players look like gems. Decent back-up: Marc Guiu has come off the bench to score a couple of goals for Barca this season, it's why Xavi sometimes prefers him to Vitor Roque. Fermin Lopez is Xavi's best bet to cover for the Pedri-Frenkie-Gundo midfield trio. In defence, Hector Fort's performance during Barca's Copa Del Rey elimination would give Xavi some relief following Balde's injury. Not bad players to have on your bench. Yet to prove himself: We're yet to see more of Marc Casado and Pau Victor. The midfielder and striker are yet to establish themselves in the dynamics of the first team. Let's visualize our ranking:"

Thankfully, for the Red Devils, they were able to score two more to make the score 4-2 and book a spot in the FA Cup quarter-finals. After the game, Ten Hag told the BBC: ""I think job done. ""In the first 25 minutes, on our side, we were very good and controlled the game. ""We had the possession and were really controlling it very good. We scored two very good goals and were creating one, two or three more, and it could have been 3-0 or 4-0. ""Out of nothing, actually, they [Newport] scored a goal. Then, straight after half-time, they scored another goal and I have to criticise the team for that. ""Then we started all over and showed character and resilience, fought back and got the third and fourth goal."" Here are some reactions to Ten Hag's comments from X. 💬 CharlieHaffenden: ""Erik ten Hag needs to learn how to be humble in victory. No credit given to Newport County whatsoever and a claim that they 'scored from nothing' when they matched Man Utd for big periods of the second half. Not a good look."" 💬 marcus_mufc: ""Ten Hag absolutely classless there, no respect for Newport's efforts, 'we should have won 3 or 4 nil, they created chances from nothing' did anyone mention how much Newport's team cost, no don't think so."" 💬 YannTear: ""What a misery ten Hag is. No feel for Newport's status and their efforts: 'They created nothing...' Charmless man."" 💬 CDA2004: ""Struggling for a good 70 minutes against a league 2 team but yeah they had nothing."" 💬 munzero8: ""Many of his post-match comments raise questions about his understanding of the game.""

'It might sound a bit harsh': Souness claims Marcus Rashford is the 'bad apple' in the dressing room,https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-02-03-it-might-sound-a-bit-harsh-souness-claims-marcus-rashford-is-the-bad-apple-in-the-dressin/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Daily Mail,2024-02-03T06:48:19.000Z,"It is not difficult to notice that Marcus Rashford has a bad period in his football career. He is one of the most discussed players in the Man United squad, but all the noise is not about his football achievements. Graeme Souness also shared his opinion on Rashford's situation, calling him a 'bad apple' in the Man United team.Quoted by Daily Mail, Souness said: ""When I look at the way Marcus Rashford’s career is crashing, I can’t help thinking back to the Liverpool dressing room I was a part of and what we would have had to say about a team-mate behaving like this.""""I assure you that we simply would not have allowed anyone to conduct himself in such a way. The other pros in our dressing room would have slaughtered him. He would have been called ‘the idiot.’ ‘The village idiot.’ He would have been hounded. Ridiculed. Ours wasn’t a dressing room of saints but we had a night out at the right time.""""I believe it would have been the same response in Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United dressing room. Rashford wouldn’t have got away with this behaviour at that club in the past because the senior players would have pointed out to him that it’s not the way to act. Fergie would certainly not have tolerated it, either.""""Ten Hag is not in a position to sell Rashford, with his own position under scrutiny and United’s squad a shadow of those in Fergie’s time in charge. Rashford is putting Ten Hag under all sorts of pressure.""""Make no mistake, though - if this carries on, he will damage that dressing room and Manchester United won’t be successful. It might sound a bit harsh to say it but he is the bad apple - undermining the management and the team.""""He will have pals in that dressing room, but even they will be looking at him and asking, ‘do we want someone like that with us?'""With all the noise and controversy surrounding Rashford, he still has the support of his teammates.

Barca consider selling Frenkie De Jong or Gundogan 'to raise money',https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-09-barca-consider-selling-frenkie-de-jong-or-gundogan-to-raise-money/,Kingsley_,OnzeTv3,2024-02-09T06:50:03.000Z,"Frenkie De Jong is no longer untouchable at Barca. According to OnzeTV3, Barcelona are seriously considering selling the Dutchman to raise money in the summer. The same goes for Ilkay Gundogan and some other senior players, including Ter Stegen. Barca believes they can only raise the required funds to appease FFP if they make a big sale. It would hurt Barca if they are to part ways with De Jong considering what he brings to the team technically. However, the Dutchman is the highest earner at the club and Barca have unsuccessfully been trying to lower his salary. If those efforts continue to hit a wall by the summer, selling the 26-year-old would become a real possibility. Barcelona 'putting pressure' on Frenkie De Jong over his futureIt is expected that several players will follow Xavi out of Barca in the summer, including the likes of Sergi Roberto and Marcos Alonso who will become free agents then. But the big question is who the club sells to raise the money it desperately needs to hire a new coach and register new players."

Things could only be possible if Barca sell several big players.Martinelli is a key Arsenal player whose current deal expires only in 2027. Mitoma also has three years left on his contract with Brighton while his estimated value is €50m. Same for Kvaratskhelia, although the sources emphasises that the Georgian is among the lowest-paid players in the Napoli squad and he may be willing to sign for a big club as soon as possible.Here are the players' stats this season:- Gabriel Martinelli: seven goals, three assists in 28 appearances;- Kaoru Mitoma: three goals, six assists in 25 appearances;- Khvicha Kvaratskhelia: six goals, five assists in 30 appearances."
Crazy physique & 3 other things Brian Brobbey could bring to Man United,https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-23-goals-4-other-things-brian-brobbey-could-bring-with-him-to-manchester/,Toby Prince,Tribuna,2024-01-23T18:44:58.000Z,"Not for the first time, Brian Brobbey is linked with a move to Man United. United are yet to make an official offer for the Dutch striker but fans are already curious about another business proposition with Ajax and what this 21-year-old player could bring.Say no more!1. Finishing Brobbey is ice-cold in front of goal - a trait that is much-needed at Man United. In an underwhelming Ajax side this season, he has still managed to score 15 goals in 26 appearances across all competitions. He also hit double figures last season. Beyond goals, two stats stand out when it comes to Brobbey:8.84 progressive passes received per game on average;9.14 touches in the opponent's penalty area on average.It means that Brobbey practically lives in the opposition’s penalty area, he’s a fox in the box. In comparison, Rasmus Hojlund averages 4.93 touches in the opponent's penalty area while Marcus Rashford does 6.07.2. Pace & strength Standing at 5”9”, Brobbey doesn't rely on his height to hurt defences. Instead, he uses his pace and raw power along with clever movement and clinical finishing to be so deadly in attack.A good example is his recent goal against RKC Waalwijk. Brobbey received the ball on the edge of the box, then used his pace and strength to beat his marker before finishing superbly with his weaker left foot.  3. Link-up play Brobbey is also effective in linking up play in midfield areas to help progress possession. He occasionally drops into deeper regions to offer assistance to his teammates and then accelerates the play with his pace. His preferred method, however, is to do it all by himself. A decent dribbler, Brobbey attempts one dribble per game on average (h/t Fbref) and mostly uses it to penetrate the opponent’s penalty area. The image below (h/t Wyscout) shows his all-time carries and dribbles. You can see that he usually takes the ball near the penalty area to carry it inside and, ideally, round it off with a strike.4. Chance creationBrobbey is not selfish, he works hard for his team. He also possesses good vision in the final third to create chances for his teammates. He has four assists thus far and created about 30 goalscoring chances in the league.  But Brian Brobbey is no Hollywood playmaker like Bruno Fernandes — he won’t bother with risky passes to satisfy the crowd. Rather, he’ll do the elbow grease he does best: outmuscle his opponents and square the ball. If his recent assist against NEC looks familiar to his goal shown above, that tells you how strong the lad is with his body.Brian Brobbey refuses to rule out Man United transfer after almost joining in 2022"

Here's what Mbappe's shirt would look like if the legendary Croatian leaves Madrid in the summer: Number 9For the first time since records began, the number 9 shirt is vacant at Real Madrid for a season. This follows Karim Benzema's exit with Joselu choosing the number 14 rather than touching the big jersey.

Players who receive this card will be temporarily removed from the field for 10 minutes for committing a 'cynical' foul or showing dissent towards a match official. As such, the punishment will be something in between a booking and a sending-off and will resemble sin-bins used in other sports, like rugby.The International Football Association board, the game's lawmakers, have approved the idea for trials. The next season's FA Cup, men's and women's, could see the introduction of a blue card as the FA are volunteering to provide the testing ground for the new rule.Sin-bins won't be used in the European Championship 2024 or the Champions League next season.

Rice & Trossard 10/10: Arsenal player ratings in West Ham rout,https://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-02-11-rice-trossard-1010-arsenal-player-ratings-in-west-ham-rout/,Aleksei Blokhin,Tribuna,2024-02-11T16:02:38.000Z,"Arsenal thrashed West Ham 6-0 at London Stadium. Here's how we rated the players.Rice: 10/10. A midfield masterclass that silenced the booing West Ham crowd — to the point of them applauding him when he came off. Rice's two set-piece assists made the difference today and a cherry on the cake in the form of a brilliant long-range screamer. Trossard: 10. A Rolls Royce display in the false nine position. Linked up incredibly well with the teammates, dropping deep when required and getting into shooting areas using his excellent positional sense. Scored a lovely goal to mark this perfect performance.Odegaard: 9. Was the Gunners' most creative player today, always coming up with ways to trouble the opposition defenders with his passing and movement. Two assists today.Saliba: 8. Rose highest in the box to break the deadlock for the Gunners shortly after the half-hour's mark. Rock-solid at the back.Gabriel: 8. Overtook Thomas Vermaelen to become Arsenal's second-highest-scoring defender in history with a nice header to score the Gunners' third goal. He now has 14 strikes for Arsenal.Saka: 8. Started rather poorly, losing the ball way too often in the first 30 minutes of the game but got on after scoring a penalty. Scored the Gunners' fifth after absolutely destroying Aguerd on a turn.White: 7.5. It might have gone unnoticed but Benny Blanco's performance was amazing today. Played in an inverted role, helping Arsenal deal with the absence of Zinchenko. White drifting inside helped the Gunners play through the Hammers press.Kiwior: 7. Forced to play at left-back due to injuries and did well considering he's a centre-back after all. Good in one-on-one situations, not particularly helpful going forward.Havertz: 6. Still looks a bit lost in the Arsenal midfield. It feels like he doesn't belong in the midfield as he doesn't serve any useful purpose there, which begs the question — where does he belong at all?Martinelli: 6. Had a couple of bright moments but was anonymous for a large part of the game.Others: Raya, Nelson, Elneny, Nwaneri, Cedric 6.5; Nketiah 6."
Revealed: Jude Bellingham's punishment if found guilty of calling Mason Greenwood a 'rapist',https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-02-14-revealed-jude-bellinghams-punishment-if-found-guilty-of-calling-mason-greenwood-a-rapist/,Meghna @ 1819,Cope,2024-02-14T17:44:00.000Z,"According to Spanish publication Cope, a reliable source, Jude Bellingham faces a ban of at least four La Liga games if he's found guilty of calling Mason Greenwood a 'rapist'. There is no audio of the incident but lip-readers appointed by La Liga during the investigation have confirmed Bellingham did use that word. Now the issue is under scrutiny by the Spanish Football Association, which will appoint a judge to decide how to proceed. Although Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 in their recent encounter, the match was marred by the controversy of Bellingham calling Greenwood a 'rapist' during an on-field tussle. It's a taunt to the rape and assault charges made against the Manchester United loanee by his partner. Reacting to the controversy, Getafe boss Jose Bordalas shared his full support for Greenwood. He said: ""It’s not up to me, it’s the club, La Liga and the Federation that have to make an assessment about it.""The only thing that I can say is that I ask for respect from Mason Greenwood because he is a great guy.""He is a man who respects everyone and has exemplary behaviour.""

The major sides like Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United and Chelsea have not made a single signing and seem to be satisfied with the prospect of going past the window without any new acquisitions.A major reason behind the majority of Premier League clubs not signing players is because of their fear of breaching the strict Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules set by the league. Everton have already been docked 10 points earlier this season for doing the same for last season and Nottingham Forest are also under threat of facing punishment.After most clubs spent lavishly in the 2023 summer window, they don’t have the necessary means to spend big in the winter window without breaching the spending limits.

Their club president said so himself, telling journalists how Barca could exploit a possible loan deal for a new midfielder.

According to Fabrizio Romano, Barca have lost out on two midfield targets they carefully analyzed for January. One of those midfielders is the highly talented Belgian star Arthur Vermeeren. Romano has given his trademark 'Here We Go' claiming the 18-year-old has reached an agreement to sign for Atletico Madrid. Romano reveals how Atletico offered an initial €15m package to land the talented midfielder. The total package could reach €25m. Barca simply couldn't make such an offer to Royal Antwerp. Meanwhile, Barca have also missed out on Manchester City's combative midfielder Kalvin Phillips. Phillips will join West Ham on loan after an agreement was reached with Man City. Barca were probably beaten off because West Ham offered to sign the player permanently at the end of the season.

He had been part of the Samuel Eto'o Academy in Cameroon for four years before joining Barca in 2010 to spend five more formative years in La Masia. Barca let him go to Ajax for merely €150,000 — a sum that rose by 340 when he transferred from Inter Milan to Man United last summer.Although he was disappointed by a lack of faith from Barcelona, Onana still has warm feelings for his former club: ""Barcelona is my home and I grew up there. I have a very, very good relationship since I left"".Right-back: Samuel OkunowoBack in the day, top clubs didn't have scouts in every corner of the planet, so stars had to align for youngsters like Samuel Okunowo to be noticed by big clubs.Barca scouts discovered the Nigerian at a U18 tournament in 1997; they were sent there to watch Xavi, then a budding midfielder from La Masia, but Okunowo was so good the Catalans offered him a trial less than an hour after the final in which Nigeria beat Spain 3-2.Okunowo earned himself a first-team promotion after just one season with Barca B and made 21 appearances in 1998-99 for Louis van Gaal’s La Liga-winning side.Unfortunately, those 21 appearances was all he ever had at the club. Okunowo's career afterwards was unremarkable but could make every travel blogger drool: he's been to Portugal, Greece, Romania, Albania, Ukraine, Nigeria and even Maldives. England also appears on the Nigerian's CV — thanks to a stint at eighth-tier Walthamstow FC; from playing next to Luis Figo to the bottom of the football pyramid.A few years ago, the club invited Samuel to participate in a Barca Legends charity match, where he met some of his former teammates.Centre-backs: Yaya Toure, Alex SongDefinitely one of Barca's most iconic African players. Yaya Toure played a crucial role for both Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles within three years. We haven't put Toure at centre-back for no reason – that's where he was forced to play the 2009 Champions League final, the biggest match of his career, due to injuries and suspensions of other players.The Ivorian had the potential to stay at the club for many years, but his relationship with Guardiola was too tense for that. Pep reportedly felt Yaya didn’t back him enough and opted to bet on 20-year-old Sergio Busquets, a decision heavily criticised by fans at the time. Although Toure's exit was still considered a big loss, Guardiola's bet paid off for everyone involved.Next to Yaya in our team is Alex Song. After a breakthrough 2011/12 season with Arsenal, in which he delivered 11 Premier League assists, the defensive midfielder signed for Barca as a backup for Sergio Busquets and Javier Mascherano. The Cameroonian never lived up to the expectations and spent two years on loan at West Ham before joining one of just three teams Leo Messi has ever failed to beat after seeing his contract ripped up.Song's most memorable moment at Camp Nou would make an 8/10 Curb Your Enthusiasm episode. As Barca were about to lift the La Liga trophy, Song thought Carles Puyol wanted him to do it instead of Eric Abidal, who'd just come back from a liver transplant.In a recent interview, Song admitted he ‘didn’t give a f**k’ about playing at Barca and simply enjoyed the life of a billionaire. He has recently retired from football, ending his player career in… Djibouti.Left-back: Ez AbdeThe Moroccan was one of La Masia’s best attackers a few years ago and played a role in the second half of Xavi’s first season. Abde was so highly rated that even then-Spain boss Luis Enrique debated on which country he should represent.Following the breakthrough of Lamine Yamal and Fermin, Abde was forced to leave Barcelona again permanently. But one thing his La Masia peers would be jealous of is Abde's knack for scoring bangers.Central midfielders: Seydou Keita, Franck KessieOne of the undeservedly less talked-about heroes of the Guardiola era. Keita was a versatile midfielder with a great first touch, vision, and an underrated ability to score goals – he found the net 22 times in 4 years at the club.""He never plays poorly. He makes my job easier,"" Pep once said about the Malian. Even when the relationship got tense between the two and the player barely had any game time, Guardiola would assure Seydou would stay as he is ‘the most generous player’ Pep had ever known.What happened to one of Barca's most underrated footballers ever and Pep Guardiola's first signing? AnsweredThe one to play alongside Keita would be Franck Kessie. Cules would forever be grateful to the Ivorian for scoring a late winner in the biggest Clasico of the 2022/23 season. One of the most glorious episodes of Xavi’s time at Barca, for sure.Despite only spending a year at the club, the Ivorian proved himself as a true professional, never complaining about his back-up role and agreeing to leave when the club needed money from his sale.""I miss the support of the fans Barca fans,"" said Kessie not long after leaving. ""I try to give Barcelona all my support and follow every game.""Right winger: Munir El HaddadiIt’s quite shocking to realise the former wonderkid is nearly 30…The Moroccan forward was part of Barcelona for a long eight years, winning 11 trophies and serving as a decent backup most of the time – 12 goals and 11 assists across 52 appearances for one of the best Barca sides is not what many footballers achieve.Munir was seen as the perfect Luis Enrique player given his diligence and ruthlessness in front of goal. However, once the treble-winning coach left the club, his trusted soldier immediately followed suit — partly because despite brief spells of good form, he never really unleashed his potential in full.Munir reminded the Barca crowd of his existence in early 2023 when he scored against Blaugrana with a thrilling Las Palmas side. Aptly, the one who assisted him was another ex-La Masia talent Sandro.Left winger: Pierre-Emerick AubameyangStreets will never forget how good the Gabonese was under Xavi and what kind of effort he put in to join Barca. He bagged 13 goals in just half a season, massively contributing to the Catalans' top-4 finish in a challenging campaign.Even though Auba will probably hang up his boots soon, he is still capable of recording over 20 goal contributions per season, proving this at Marseille.Strikers: Samuel Eto'o, Emmanuel AmunikeThe Cameroonian is a cult figure for Barca. He is still 5th on the list of Blaugrana's all-time top goalscorers — ahead of Rivaldo, Hristo Stoichkov, Neymar — and there are no signs anyone would beat him in the near future.Eto'o is also the only player on this list to have ever played for Real Madrid. He had been part of the Whites from 1996 to 2000 and had a chance to come back after his successful time at Mallorca. He didn't want that comeback at all, though, revealing later that he hadn’t felt respected by Real Madrid’s academy teammates and suggesting their club didn't like black people.Emmanuel Amunike is the final name in our XI. A hero of the 1996 Olympics won by Nigeria, the forward shortly signed for Barca to make the difference up front. But just like his fellow Nigerian teammate Okunowo, Amunike fell victim to great competition — Louis van Gaal had Rivaldo, Hristo Stoichkov, Luis Figo and Luis Enrique at his disposal.Nonetheless, Emmanuel had one really special moment in the Blaugrana shirt — scoring the winner in the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain.Amunike hung up his boots after short spells at Albacete and in Jordan, but his trophy cabinet is impressive nonetheless: two La Liga titles, Copa del Rey, Olympic gold, African Cup of Nations, CAF Champions League and even the African Player of the Year award.How do you like the team? What changes would you make? Maybe you’d like to put Kevin-Prince Boateng or some rising stars like Mikayil Faye?"

Fans are worried whether the Blues will be hit with charges and sanctions as well.However, as per David Ornstein, there's nothing to worry about at the moment, although Chelsea would need to change their approach going forward.The reporter said on The Athletic Football Podcast: “A lot of people have been saying ‘what is going on with Chelsea?’ Because their spend has been unprecedented since the Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital ownership came on board. A bit of housekeeping to explain how they are compliant this time around.“They will have to be careful going forwards, because the costs will continue and it will be interesting to see how they balance the books after the Premier League capped amortisation of transfer fees, from no cap, to a cap of five years.“We will all be watching closely to see if they sell someone like Conor Gallagher in January because those homegrown players represent pure profit. Whether you like it or not, they’ve actually done quite well financially to fall within the limits.”So basically it means that Chelsea would no longer be able to spread transfer fees over seven- or eight-year periods as they did with the likes of Enzo Fernandez.

Interestingly, all are below 22. Barcelona have a youthful side with an average age of 25. Should Motta move to Catalonia, the following players may benefit:Vitor Roque - 18Lamine Yamal - 16Fermin Lopez - 20Pedri - 20Gavi - 19Alejandro Balde - 20Fabregas picks manager who 'sucked in Barca philosophy' to succeed Xavi"

Xavi would also be happy to play with four 'midfielders' again as Cancelo would often occupy central areas to boost the team's creativity.Lamine Yamal deserves to be a permanent starter, as well as undisputed first-choice midfielders Pedri, Frenkie de Jong and Ilkay Gundogan.This back line is far from perfect this season, but at least we've got some depth this time: Hector Fort and Pau Cubarsi are proving themselves as reliable options while Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Inigo Martinez could come back soon.❓ Your thoughts on this selection?"

Exploring the Excitement of Digital Wagers in Sports Through Crypto Betting Sites,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-30-exploring-the-excitement-of-digital-wagers-in-sports-through-crypto-betting-sites/,Alex,,2024-01-30T04:15:55.000Z,"If you've been keeping an eye on the latest trends in sports betting, you might have noticed that digital currency, specifically through crypto betting sites, has started to change the game. Imagine being able to place bets on your favorite sports teams or matches from anywhere in the world with just a few clicks and without the hassle of traditional currency. But what exactly is driving this digital transformation, and how does it affect the average sports fan?The Allure of Anonymity and EfficiencyOne big reason people use cryptocurrency for betting is the anonymity it provides. Whether you're trying to keep your hobby private or you just prefer an extra layer of security, betting with digital currencies can give you that peace of mind. Plus, when we talk about speed in sports, we're not just referring to the athletes. Transactions with cryptocurrency are lightning-fast compared to bank transfers. This means you can place a bet just minutes before a game starts or quickly cash out your winnings once the final whistle blows. These features are real game-changers for those who like to ride the adrenaline wave of live sports betting.Blockchain Technology’s Winning Goal in BettingFor those not already in the loop, blockchain is the tech behind cryptocurrency, and it's about as revolutionary as when sports broadcasts made the leap from radio to television. It's not just about faster transactions; blockchain brings an unprecedented level of security and transparency to betting. Smart contracts, for example, automatically execute wagers when certain conditions are met, ensuring that payouts are fair and timely. No more worries about if the house will pay up—blockchain technology is the referee that makes sure every play is fair.The New Era of Sports Fandom With Digital BetsWith the accessibility of crypto betting sites, we're witnessing a new era in sports fandom. It's not just about rooting for your team anymore; now, fans across the globe are placing bets on matches in real time, increasing the stakes and the excitement of each game. In addition, these platforms often foster a sense of community where sports fans can share tips, celebrate victories, and even commiserate over losses. For many, it's this social connectivity in the digital age that enhances the sports betting experience and keeps them coming back for more.The Balance Sheet of Crypto Sports BettingIt's not all about cheering from the sidelines, though. There's real money at play here, and with the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the risks are as real as the potential rewards. Betting with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies means staying informed about the market and making educated wagers to keep your finances in good shape. While the learning curve might be steep for new users, those who take the time to understand how it all works could find themselves in possession of more than just bragging rights when their team wins.Staying Onside With RegulationsIn the world of sports, rules are there for a reason, and the same goes for betting. The legality of using cryptocurrency for gambling varies across the board, so it's critical to understand the laws of the game where you are. And beyond the letter of the law, there's an ethical dimension to this discussion. The increased accessibility and ease of use that crypto betting sites offer could encourage responsible gambling but could also pose a risk to susceptible individuals. It's in the industry's best interest to promote fair play, not just within the sports themselves but in the betting that surrounds them.So there you have it, a dive into the wave of change that cryptocurrency has brought into the sports betting arena. It’s an exciting time, with the digital and the physical realms of sports intermingling more than ever before. Whether you're a seasoned bettor or a curious onlooker, one thing is clear: the combination of sports passion and crypto innovation is redefining what it means to be a fan in today’s world."

When fit, the Spaniard is one of the best players in the world — and having him back after 284 days on the sidelines is a huge positive.Thiago made a very short cameo at the Emirates but he'll surely be getting more time on the pitch as he builds up his fitness. And it will help the Reds massively in the final months of the season.Macca at no. 6It's difficult to spot a brilliant midfield performance when a team loses, but Alexis Mac Allister put in a very good shift at the base of the midfield.

They can't take this trophy [for top scorer of the year] away from me because it's a reality. So it makes me even happier.”Ronaldo has not won a Ballon d’Or award since 2017, and has seen Messi win it three times after that and surpass his tally of five Ballon d’Or awards with relative ease. So him being frustrated at the Ballon d’Or or FIFA The Best awards is not at all surprising.The Portuguese forward won three awards at the Globe Soccer Awards, including the top goal-scorer of 2023 for scoring the majority of his 54 goals in the Saudi Pro League for Al Nassr. 'Bro is so insecure': Fans react as Cristiano Ronaldo says Saudi league is better than Ligue 1"
'Deserved defeat': Thomas Tuchel rips into his Bayern Munich players in fiery interview,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-22-deserved-defeat-thomas-tuchel-rips-into-his-bayern-munich-players-in-fiery-interview/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,SPORTbible,2024-01-22T11:09:39.000Z,"Bayern Munich's hopes for a 12th consecutive Bundesliga title are in jeopardy after a surprising 1-0 loss to Werder Bremen, leaving manager Thomas Tuchel visibly furious. Despite their decade-long dominance, Bayern struggled throughout the match, and Mitchell Weiser's second-half goal secured a well-deserved victory for Werder.After the final whistle, Tuchel didn't hold back, delivering a harsh assessment of his team's lackluster performance. He questioned their attitude and asserted that they ""deserved"" the loss against the 13th-placed Werder Bremen, who have secured six wins in 18 Bundesliga matches.Quoted by the SPORTbible, Tuchel said: ""We didn't play for 70 minutes like a team that wanted to force a win, that was playing for the championship, that wanted to give an answer. We only did this for 20 minutes. 20 minutes are not enough to achieve the goals we set ourselves. That's not what we're signing up for here.""""When you sign for a club like Bayern Munich, you sign for one hundred percent. That applies to the coach, that applies to the players. We didn’t deliver that today.""We played as if we were 10 points ahead and still had a Champions League game on Tuesday. We were extremely static in the first half. We lost a lot of the ball, allowed a lot of counterattacks, and were sloppy in possession. Deserved defeat.""Tuchel continued: ""We will hold the team accountable. On Wednesday we have the opportunity to do better – and we have to do better.""""If you play for Bayern Munich and have a game on Sunday, you don’t have to be top on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday – but you especially have to be top on Sunday. We certainly weren't. We are clearly lagging behind our demands.""100,000 Harry Kane jerseys were sold: How much did FC Bayern Munich earn from them?"
Dembele picks 'very big club' between Barca and PSG - he is wrong,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-14-dembele-picks-very-big-club-between-barca-and-psg-he-is-wrong/,Toby Prince,PSG Talk,2024-02-14T09:13:17.000Z,"Ousmane Dembele says PSG is a big club like Barcelona. “Barcelona is a very big club, we know that,” he said.“But PSG is also a huge club, I see it on and off the pitch. When you go to town, you are immediately recognised.“Honestly, apart from the weather, there is no big change for me. Same for the stadium: Camp Nou is huge and full of history. But at the Parc des Princes, the exceptional atmosphere, at each match, the public supports us.”Dembele comparison is understandable as he is currently on the books of the French champions. However, historically there is a clear difference between both clubs. Barca is one of the most decorated clubs in Europe with 14 European titles, including five Champions League. Whereas PSG have won just two continental honours and yet to taste success in the elite competition.

Concerns about complying with financial fair play regulations have also arisen, given Newcastle's substantial net spend following the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund's takeover in October 2021.To address financial considerations, the potential sale of Almiron to Al Shabab, a club not owned by the PIF, could play a role.

Despite playing just his seventh game since returning from a hamstring injury that required surgery earlier in the season, the Belgian star showcased top-notch form in the round of 16 first leg.De Bruyne not only opened the scoring with a stellar finish but also played a crucial role in Bernardo Silva's goal, putting City back in the lead. To cap it off, he provided a perfect pass for Phil Foden to secure the win in stoppage time. Despite starting only three of these seven games, he boasts two goals and five assists.The return of City's talisman has undeniably elevated the team's performance during this critical phase of the season. Remarkably fresh after an extended break, De Bruyne issued an indirect warning to rivals Arsenal and Liverpool by expressing that he believes he is nowhere near his best yet.""I'm trying to play good football and enjoy myself. It's been a long five, six months but I'm happy to be back helping the team win games and do my best,"" De Bruyne told TNT Sports after the win.""I feel alright.

He let Diogo Jota go past him too easily for the first, failed to mark Dominik Szoboszlai for his goal and gave the ball away before the fourth.Some Chelsea fans seem to be done with Silva, whose contract is set to expire at the end of the season.

Quoted by the BBC, he explained: ""Our main problems came from set-plays and corners and crosses so it is something we need to work on. ""When we conceded we showed great spirit and fight to stick with it at a place like this that was rocking.""You relish playing when you win. They are a good team and have shown it at Villa Park. ""It was relentless in the second half and we know we have players on the bench that can come on and win football matches for us.""

11 British managers and if they could do Pep Guardiola's job at Man City just as well — ranked,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-30-11-british-managers-and-if-they-could-do-pep-guardiolas-job-at-man-city-just-as-well-rank/,eugene_vasilev,Tribuna,2024-01-30T15:00:00.000Z,"Pep Guardiola has been at Man City for almost eight years and won it all. As if it wasn’t boring already, Jurgen Klopp’s departure from Liverpool is only supposed to make life easier for the Spaniard and his well-oiled machine (no pun intended).But one day, Pep will step down and someone else will have to replace him — why can’t it be a British manager? They don’t say cerveza to mean beer, but they know a thing or two about football.Let’s not beat about the bush: we have selected the 11 finest British managers of this century and ranked them according to their capacity to replace Pep Guardiola at Man City. Read on!Tony PulisIf you think us foolish enough to put Tony Pulis into the top tier for memes, think again — we’re not here to play to the gallery. Because let’s face it: Tony Pulis would be a horrible successor to Pep.It’s not even Tony’s Route One football that wouldn’t suit Man City or the fact Bernardo Silva’s ballerina hands are no match to Rory Delap’s muscles. It’s that he would bore Man City players to death with stories about his time at Gillingham in 1996. Even when you listen to Pulis crack stories on a podcast you feel like you’re missing out on most jokes because you just weren’t there when Pulis got the Gills promoted from the Third Division.Tony Pulis — sacked in the morning (at Man City)!David MoyesWe’ll say it — David Moyes is vastly underrated. You’ve got the entire Premier League fondling Ange Postecoglou’s second chin for going suicidal v Chelsea and saying ‘mate’ but not a peep about the Scotsman who’s doing a tremendous job at West Ham. For three years running, Moyes got the Hammers into Europe, and an actual trophy is the cherry on the cake. David’s only shot at a top club job went tits up, although let’s be honest: only a 61-year-old Sir Alex Ferguson would’ve adequately replaced Fergie at 71. For this reason, the jury is still out on Moysey, but he’d definitely be good enough to bring a trophy to Man City.Sean DycheIt’s a huge myth that Sean Dyche is a dinosaur that can only count the sum of four plus four plus two. At one point in the 2023/24 campaign, Dyche’s Everton had a better xG than Guardiola’s Man City. Now imagine what happens if Dyche has Erling Haaland instead of Neal Maupay up front.Fine, maybe Dyche doesn’t replace Guardiola completely, but he’s good enough to do a domestic cup double. And he also has a superior taste in music.Brendan RodgersIf Brendan Rodgers is good enough to win the FA Cup with Leicester City, he’s good enough to do it with Man City.Rodgers is so in love with Spain and Spanish football he probably guzzles Estrellas when on holiday. Of all clubs, Rodgers had the balls to try tiki-taka at Swansea City. His Swans were actually everybody’s flavour of the mouth in 2011/12, though quite often it was possession for the sake of it: even the relegated duo of Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers each outscored 11th-placed Swansea that season.Finally, for all the great character spiel, Rodgers’ teams have a nasty record of mentally collapsing in the second half of the season — the opposite of Guardiola’s Man City. For this reason, we only put Brendan in the second tier.Sam AllardyceWe’ll have you know that Samuel Allardyce is one of the most progressive coaches of the Premier League era. He was among the first to leverage the use of data to gain an advantage over his opponents. When half the league still regarded the good ol’ 4-4-2 as God’s plan, Big Sam introduced psychotherapists, an in-house psychologist and a cryo-chamber at Bolton. Allardyce also knows how to work with star players. He convinced World Cup winner Youri Djorkaeff and Real Madrid’s former captain Fernando Hierro to join his modest Bolton side. Big Sam even managed to get the best out of El Hadji Diouf — the cantankerous Senegalese called him ‘a good man, like a daddy’. Results followed: for three years in a row, the Wanderers were on the heels of the traditional top four.You might point out that Big Sam’s latest stints weren’t as successful as his Bolton years, but that’s because he’s not given the chance he deserves. As he himself pointed out: “I won’t ever be going to a top-four club because I’m not called Allardici, just Allardyce”.Some people luck into top jobs, while others get nothing even after decades of hard work. We’re convinced Big Sam would do a stellar job to replace Pep Guardiola at Man City — he only needs that chance.Tim SherwoodIf Tim Sherwood were awarded a point for everything he has an opinion about, he’d make City champions with 105 points. Alas, that’s not how football works, so Tactics Tim should keep providing soundbites for TalkSPORT.Steve BruceWhere do we even begin with Steve Bruce? Probably by giving him his due: few managers reach 1,000 games. But how long would Bruce last at Man City? A few days maybe and not because he’s a Man United legend, but rather because he doesn’t seem to know what he wants. He said in late 2023: “I'm itching to go back in, not necessarily as a manager [...] I'd like to get back involved in some capacity [...] Maybe consultancy... something along those lines. That sporting director role rings a nice bell for me.”In addition, City players might be underwhelmed by Bruce’s tactical understanding. Don’t get us wrong, Steve Bruce is a genuinely good man, but it’s hard to imagine Rodri taking instructions like ‘hoof it, lad’ from the touchline.Alan PardewBy all means, Alan Pardew is not a bad manager. His French-speaking Newcastle United side were one of the most entertaining in the Premier League in the early 2010s, and he was also a Jesse Lingard dab away from winning the FA Cup and doing the second dance of the day.However, Pards’ latest spells at CSKA Sofia and Aris Thessaloniki, of all places, have been subpar — just like Sam Allardyce’s short-lived spells at Leeds and West Brom, you may point out. But where Big Sam has bags of self-confidence and extravagance, Alan Pardew has a list of controversies and a Swedish wife.Neil WarnockDifferent philosophies, same inspiration. If Guardiola goes, Neil Warnock must be the first name on the Sheikh’s replacement list.Hear us out: no one reaches 1,626 games in English football, the all-time record for a manager, by being incompetent. Just like no one else carries signed pictures of himself in a bumbag — not even Pep Guardiola.Neil Warnock also holds the record for most promotions in English football (8), which would be a valuable skill if Man City are eventually sent to the National League for cooking the books.Unless you’re a Leeds United fan, what’s not to like about Neil Warnock?Gareth SouthgateGareth Southgate is a special case: he’s England’s most successful manager in the XXI century, but no top club would touch him with a bargepole. We insist he’s not as bad as people want him to be and he might actually be a decent pick for Man City. With some luck in a penalty shootout he might even nick a trophy.By the way, Southgate was the Middlesbrough manager on the day they famously thrashed Man City 8-1 in 2008. Gareth Southgate might not be an adequate replacement for Pep Guardiola, but at least he’d go a full circle.Frank LampardIt’s always a great story when a legendary player leads his team to success as a manager, so how cool it would be for Man City legend Frank Lampard to repeat the trick.Lamps may have lucked himself into the Chelsea job in 2019, but hey, he still managed a top-four finish with a transfer ban and without Eden Hazard. This alone leaves Tim Sherwood without a company in the bottom tier of our rankings.However, Frank’s career afterwards went downhill.

However, Mourinho demonstrated incredible confidence.""Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm a European champion and I think I'm a special one,"" Mourinho said. Mind that he said he was 'a special one', not 'the special one': of course, Jose knew he was not unique or irreplaceable.Speaking to Sky Sports in 2019, Jose explained why he said that.""When I gave my first press conference I was asked if I was ready for the Premier League,"" Jose said. ""I thought: 'What? I just won the Champions League and you are thinking that I am nobody?'""So, I went a little bit aggressive by saying I am not one from the bottle, I am a special one.

A recent one that springs to mind is the famous Cantona Collar look of our 2022/23 shirts. Ahead of the summer, designs for the 2024/25 season have been 'leaked' online. It once again makes for a pleasant retro aesthetic, with the main sponsor Snapdragon looking similar to the Vodafone logo from the early 2000s. After TeamViewer, Snapdragon - part of the Qualcomm family - will adorn the front of the shirts. The two parties signed a deal worth £60 million back in September. The home shirts are the standard red of Manchester while the away ones are dark blue and bear the same features."

The Portuguese only recently played his first full game for Forest in their 3-2 defeat to Brentford.However, that's not why he is all over social media. Footage has re-emerged of Tavares “snogging” dogs.The lengthy video which previously did the rounds in 2021, before his move to north London from Benfica, showed him kissing multiple dogs - with plenty of tongue.Fans responded by voicing their outrage and shock at the uncomfortable video.One baffled X user wrote: “Why am I seeing a video of a man SNOGGING a DOG?” while another joked: “Oh, I see Nuno Tavares is trending. Perhaps we are selling him? Nope, only yet more videos of him letting dogs clean his gums.”A third fumed: “I can’t believe that man is snogging multiple dogs. Like they are going to town inside his mouth,” while a fourth added: “That’s enough internet for one day.”Tavares played the first three Premier League games of the season for Forest, where he received two yellow cards. He was either not included in the squad or left on the bench from September 23 until the Brentford clash this weekend.The defender arrived at Arsenal for £8million in 2021, making all 22 of his appearances that season.

The Blues were played off the park by the home side. Chelsea found it difficult to build from the back, giving up initiative and relying on counter-attacks. The Blues' attacking patterns were almost non-existent.And here is a screenshot posted by one fan on Reddit which showcases the Blues' problem with building up attacks.As you can see, there is no safe way for Thiago Silva to pass to a midfielder. He can play it to a full-back but passing lanes to Caicedo, Enzo and Gallagher are all blocked.Hence, Chelsea have no straightforward way of moving the ball forward. No coincidence that the Blues' overall xG in the Liverpool game was 0.83.""It’s either this, or they [midfielders] come in and are on the same line as our CBs,"" a fan nicknamed Nice Username wrote. ""In my opinion, we don’t utilise Caicedo enough as a pivot player to kick start the transition into attack - something he did well when he was at Brighton. Everything gets pushed out to the side and in possession we tend to play exclusively out through the full backs and then the wingers. It’s very frustrating and predictable.""""At this point, it's down to Pochettino's brilliant buildup play,"" another fan, Half Jase, added. ""Any time one of the CBs or Enzo/Caicedo has the ball in the central area, everyone else in midfield and attack will just push forward, having us in a whatever the hell 4-1-5 setup.""""God help us in that cup final bro hold me,"" a fan named Savings Stop added. ""You know what's funny though we probably do things right we did wrong today and do the things right wrong in the cup final.""It's fucking typical. It's like we're schizophrenic or something. We're literally the definition of a child's seesaw."""

During a Friday press conference, Guardiola was asked about Nunes settling in, and his response reflects the positive impact the midfielder is making on the team.Quoted by Mancity.com, Guardiola said: ""Absolutely. It takes time for a player when they arrive to settle with every member of the team or be in love with a guy like Matheus. Everyone is delighted to have him in the locker room; he has a specific quality that we didn’t have [before].

If the plans go through, players could find themselves cooling off in a sin-bin, akin to rugby's yellow card system.While some Premier League managers have been vocal in their opposition, Mourinho, with cautious optimism, sees the blue card as a means to prevent players from missing matches due to accumulated yellow cards if this rule is used the right way. The Portuguese said: ""I think there is always a feeling of changing things, I'm not always sure you change for better.""""I think if the sinbin means you're out for certain number of minutes but then not an accumulation of it and can play next match without suspension or five yellows I would say so.""""Something I never understand very well is from accumulation of yellow cards a payer cannot play one match, clubs pay players to play, players want to play, fans want players to play, you cannot play for accumulation of yellow cards.""""If there is something that takes it out I say yes and probably more fair than if you make a mistake or infraction in match then you pay it in that match it maybe makes sense and gives team a difficulty to deal with in that specific match.""'Who won it?': Jose Mourinho explains why Wesley Sneijder wasn't robbed in 2010 Ballon d'Or race"

West Ham fans were not pleased as Rice not only scored but also helped lead the team to a resounding win. Amid constant boos, Rice did not react much to scoring Arsenal's final goal. Ironically enough, the Gunners became a national topic for over-celebrating goals in the Liverpool win. And now, Rice has been accused of not celebrating enough. ""What a goal it was not to celebrate!"" exclaimed former Arsenal man David Seaman on his podcast. ""To see him not celebrate was strange for me, because it was just such a good goal and the icing on the cake on an incredible day for him and the club. ""It was a brilliant performance from Arsenal.

With a new young striker arriving from Brazil and multiple links to Saudi Arabia emerging, the Catalans were rumored to try and offload Lewy in the summer.But according to a recent report from Diario Sport, the club have a different plan in mind. Rather than pushing the veteran striker, whose contract at Camp Nou expires in 2025, out, Barca are ready to allow Lewandowski to decide his own future.Of course, offloading the second-highest earner would ease the club's ongoing financial struggles, but retaining such a seasoned player for another year would likely ensure 15-20 goals for Barca, which is not a bad option either.Ferran breathing down Lewandowski's neck: Barca's top five scorers this season"

Over the past seven months, De Gea was linked with several top clubs but no move materialised. That's believed to be because of his wage demands as he earned £375,000-a-week at Man United.

The question is, could the Englishman really join Barca this January? According to Mundo Deportivo, Lingard is the easiest player Barca could sign at the moment. The attacking midfielder will arrive as a free agent on a low salary that wouldn't disturb FFP. However, Lingard has not played at any level since May 2023 and that's a serious worry. The 31-year-old had unsuccessful trials at West Ham and Al Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia last summer. The ex-England international later trained with West Ham to keep fit. Two weeks ago he posted pictures on his Instagram showing he has been working hard on his fitness over in Dubai. Barca have done some smart work to sign free agents recently. Players like Christensen, Inigo Martinez, Gundogan, Kessie and Garcia all came for free. However, Barca needed the profile of those players. That's not the case with Lingard. He's an attacker and not a central/defensive midfielder Xavi is crying out for. Add that to the fact that Lingard is match rusty, most likely overweight and unfit, you'll see why the Barca bigwigs will chuckle at Lingard's offer if it ever reached their table.

Listen, I don’t know.“The club will have a big job on their hands. That is well known. To replace the manager and replace not only the manager, the staff is leaving, and there are so many things that will change. ""So the club has a big job on its hands and I am very curious which direction that will go in. But when that will be announced we will see our situation. I can’t say much about it.""“Obviously it will be the end of Jürgen Klopp’s era,” he added. “I am very glad that I am still part of it. That is why I don’t like to speak about it. I am still part of it.“That is my main focus and we will see at the end of the season. Hopefully, we have the success that we all dream of and fight for each day and, by then, there will probably be more clarification for what the club wants for the future and then we will see.”'Let's give him the farewell he deserves': Van Dijk breaks silence on Klopp exit"

Those comments either jinxed things or were not reflective of the true situation in the treatment room. The only injured player who had recovered recently was Joao Cancelo. And he isn't even fit enough to start games, at least not the game against Athletic Bilbao. During that Bilbao game, Alejandro Balde suffered a hamstring injury which might rule him out for the rest of the season, according to sources.

Bayern faced a surprising 1-0 home defeat against Werder Bremen on Sunday, putting them seven points behind the league leaders Bayer Leverkusen. This setback raises concerns about Kane's chances of securing silverware in his inaugural season with Munich.During Mail Sport's podcast ""It's All Kicking Off,"" Ian Ladyman, Sutton's co-host, mentioned Bayern's recent struggles and playfully suggested that Harry should 'come home.'He said: ""Bayern Munich lost again this weekend.

I think Harry will be looking at what's gone on at Spurs, watching their brand of football. I think there's a bit of jealousy there.""Ladyman then said: ""I was the one at the start of the season who said he'd made a mistake going to Bayern and should have stayed at Tottenham and you ridiculed me for that.""'Deserved defeat': Thomas Tuchel rips into his Bayern Munich players in fiery interview"

"Jose Mourinho at Chelsea: tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-16-jose-mourinho-at-chelsea-tactical-profile-biggest-strengths-and-possible-xis/,Aleksei Blokhin,Tribuna,2024-02-16T08:03:00.000Z,"The chair under Mauricio Pochettino is rocking, even if the Chelsea hierarchy seem to trust him. The Argentine is under immense pressure as he's sitting in tenth place in the Premier League table with the most expensively assembled squad in football history.Jose Mourinho is free after getting sacked at Roma in January. A portion of the Blues fanbase wants the Portuguese to replace Poch. Here's our analysis of the Special One.Playing styleWe all know what to expect from Jose. He doesn't change and keeps prioritising grinding out results over attractive football. Jose Mourinho has consistently emphasized counter-attacking football throughout his managerial career. His approach to counter-attacking involves a team effort centered around directness, physicality and quick decisions on when to release the ball to a teammateMourinho's teams are also known for their defensive compactness, which allows them to recover quickly into counter-attacking situations.Biggest weaknessesChelsea's new project under Todd Boehly has a heavy focus on youth players. The Blues have the youngest squad in the Premier League and this is something Mourinho is not used to. The 61-year-old might find it hard to work with such a young team.The Portuguese prefers to work with experienced players and is notorious for not giving youngsters enough time and space to prove themselves. Mo Salah and Kevin de Bruyne both left Chelsea after not getting enough minutes under Mourinho.At Roma though, Mourinho showed that he can adapt to circumstances, giving as many as 13 players their senior debuts. That was probably forced by the club's financial struggles — but it means that he can adapt to Chelsea's new policy.The question is whether the youngsters at Chelsea would accept the Portuguese demanding 110% out of each player not just in every game but in every training session. John Obi Mikel and Joe Cole argued that only Conor Gallagher would 'survive' in Mourinho's Chelsea team of their playing days.Biggest strengthsMourinho became the embodiment of Chelsea's culture of winning in the Roman Abramovich era. The Portuguese kept delivering at other clubs (except Spurs), winning the Conference League with Roma in 2022 despite operating on a low budget.The 61-year-old is also excellent at setting up defence. This is something that Chelsea have struggled with recently (40 goals conceded in 20 league games this season). Last season, his Roma side conceded just 38 goals in the same number of Serie A games despite goalkeeper Rui Patricio having a poor season (conceding 6.5 more goals than the xG of shots Roma faced).Possible Chelsea lineupsLet's imagine that Mourinho replaces Pochettino right now. He'll inherit a squad full of youngsters and injured players. We can see the Portuguese building the team around the most experienced players like Sterling and Thiago Silva, in addition to Gallagher, who looks like a perfect player for Jose.Mourinho likes playing with a traditional no. 9 and Chelsea have one — but he's not at the club right now. Yes, it's him. Romelu Lukaku is currently on loan at Roma but nothing prevents Mourinho from playing him next season if he becomes the Blues manager.Thiago Silva is out of the lineup as his contract expires this summer. The Portuguese would probably try to keep the veteran defender but it's hard to see him staying at the moment.Here is what Chelsea's starting would look like with Lukaku and no injuries next season under Mourinho."

There will be a replay at Villa Park. Here's how we rated the players today.Petrovic: 8/10. Terrific display by the Serbia goalie. The second-half save on Matty Cash was something else. Gives you the calmness that Sanchez doesn't and should keep his spot when the Spaniard is back to full fitness.Gilchrist: 7. Had to start at short notice, with Colwill getting injured in the warm-up. Put in a very decent shift defensively, making vital blocks and interceptions. Was unlucky when Villa scored early in the first half but VAR spared his blushes.Gallagher: 7. Lead the press, suffocating Villa's defence. Great movement, arriving in the box exactly when he was needed.Badiashile: 7. Adds solidity to the backline. His long-range passes are something special, too.Sterling: 6.5. Played some really good passes. Occasionally excellent in one-on-ones but lost the ball too. Looked gassed after the break.Caicedo: 6. Good defensively but offered absolutely nothing in possession, just playing the ball to the closest teammate.Palmer: 5.5. Had a mare similar to the first leg against Boro. Bad miss after he was gifted a chance by Villa in the first half, even worse miss in the middle of the second half. Great creativity though.Chilwell: 5. Had no impact in the game after coming on shortly after the hour's mark. Was expected to do more as one of the most experienced players in the squad.Broja: 4. Had a chance late in the game after coming on but wasted it making a really, really poor first touch.Madueke: 4. Wasted an easy chance shortly after Villa's disallowed goal and another one later in the first half. Oftentimes was frustrating to watch as it looks like Noni makes the worst decision out of all possible options. Was fouled the whole game but the ref almost never gave a thing for some reason.

""We started really flat. We showed lack of intensity. It was a really tough first 45 minutes. It was really tough to break down the low block of Palace,"" he told BeIN Sports.“I think lack of intensity, lack of quality also.

Nearly scored a brilliant individual goal after nutmegginng Witsel early in the first half. Produced a brilliant Zidanesque dribble shortly after the break. Then provided a brilliant assist for Joselu allowing Madrid to level the score for the second time.Joselu: 7.5. Right place, right time. Excellent positioning to score the header to equalise for Madrid late in the second half.Kroos: 7. Toni coming on changed the game for the better for Madrid as the Whites had more structure and organisation in the middle of the pitch. Excellent defensively too.Modric: 6. Scored a free-kick, with the help of Oblak, to equalise for Madrid but otherwise could have done better. Looked very leggy today.Rodrygo: 5.5. Not as involved as he would have liked.Rudiger: 5. It wasn't deliberate but his header ended up being a perfect assist for Griezmann. Shaky on a few other occasions. Difficult to blame him for the second goal though, the ball fell against him after Lunin tried to push it away.Camavinga: 5. Made a lot of mistakes and didn't connect the midfield with the forwards as expertly as he could. Barely jogged back to help Vinicius when Atleti scored their third goal — despite playing at left-back at that time.Tchouameni: 4.5. Had an off game today. Didn't bother to track back for Atleti's third goal, had very little impact going forward.Lunin: 4. Could have done better to claim the ball just before Atleti scored the opener. Really sloppy in the Morata goal, should have just caught the ball or pushed it away somewhere. Excellent save on Morata in the 82nd minute to keep Madrid in the game.Vinicius: 3. Wasted a brilliant chance early on after the ball fell to him following Bellingham's shot. Also missed an easy chance after Rodrygo was denied — although Vini was the man who created that chance for his fellow Brazilian in the first place.

"Nacho - 1, Vinicius - 8: Rating Real Madrid players in Las Palmas win",https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-27-nacho-1-vinicius-8-rating-real-madrid-players-in-las-palmas-win/,Kingsley_,,2024-01-27T17:22:06.000Z,"Real Madrid have completed another comeback. Here's how our players performedVincius — 8The Brazilian winger seemed tired coming into this game but he was a terror to Las Palmas' defence all game. He grabbed the equalizer for us and almost scored 15 minutes later but his shot was deflected for a corner. That corner led to Madrid's winner via Tchouameni. Kroos —  7Toni Kroos worked hard today. Despite his age, the German was playing as a box-to-box midfielder covering a lot of ground for Real Madrid. He didn't look slow and never seemed to miss a pass. His crowning moment was that pinpoint corner for birthday boy Tchouameni to score the winner. Camavinga — 7Camavinga was tasked with playing in defensive midfield with Tchouameni rested and he didn't disappoint anyone. The Frenchman won most of his tackles and often played the right ball to put Real Madrid on the front foot. One of those moments saw him play a worldie of a pass for Vinicius to score the equalizer. Rodrygo — 4 Today we watched a tired Rodrygo. He was damn lucky to avoid a red card as early as the 4th minute of the game when he seemingly lost his head. It's hard to remember what special thing Rodrygo did on the pitch before being subbed off in the 81st minute. We can only expect better from him. Ceballos — 3Dani Ceballos was the man chosen to replace Valverde who was rested on the day and the Spaniard made us miss Fede so much. Over the course of 59 minutes he spent on the pitch he basically did nothing to write about. Thankfully he didn't cost us a penalty in the first half. Nacho — 1What do we say about captain Nacho? The less said about his errors the better. Today he made one again as he was there to deflect the ball beyond Lunin for Las Palmas' first goal against Madrid in 6 years.

While Brahim Diaz and Andriy Lunin's individual brilliance secured the first-leg win away from home, another talking point emerged.Apparently, Benjamin Sesko's disallowed goal just two minutes into the game has become a hot topic of discussion, with many convinced that the Slovenian forward's early goal should have stood. Was it the right call to disallow it, though?Speaking in the aftermath of the game, former France international and now CBS pundit Thierry Henry shared his point of view:""I first thought it was a goal, but on the replay, you can see it is not. As a player, you are told if you are offside, don’t get involved. He interferes with Lunin – even if the push is little – and he was offside.""A look from another angleIndeed, the footage reveals that the player behind Lunin was impeding the keeper, constituting interference while being in an offside position. Therefore, it was the right call to disallow the goal.

The defender very much wears his heart on his sleeve and is totally committed to the cause. It was his display in defence against Liverpool that really impressed. His partnership with William Saliba reduced Liverpool's chances to a minimum.""On Saka, he had this to say: ""Saka is no stranger to big games but I doubt whether he will score two more important goals in back-to-back fixtures all season.

Guardiola chose not to comment on the matter after the game, adding an element of mystery to the situation, as both Walker and Maupay have yet to provide any statements.While Freeman's analysis provides some clarity, it's essential to note that the comments have not been officially confirmed by any party associated with the incident. Freeman claims Walker approached Attwell and shouted: ""I'm going to knock him [Maupay] out.""He then is said to have added: ""Wait there"", before pointing to the tunnel and walking back over to referee Jarred Gillet.According to Freeman, Walker then said: ""Ref, he spoke about my kids, he spoke about my kids, not once, but twice.""Maupay is then claimed to have said: ""I didn't, it's OK.""Gillet then responded: ""Now, now, just calm down, listen to me... think about it, think about it.""But Maupay insisted: ""That's a lie, that's not fair, I promise you.""Kyle Walker accused of cheating on wife and mistress with third woman"

In the 21st minute, Mark Flekken's goal kick went straight through the City defence, and Maupay slotted it past Ederson.City players protested for offside against both Maupay and Ivan Toney. Maupay was offside when the goal kick was taken, and Toney, coming from an offside position, blocked Nathan Ake from intercepting the long ball. However, Sky Sports commentator Seb Hutchinson clarified that awarding the goal was the correct decision.""I think some of the City players had to be explained that rule as well. If Toney had touched it, it would have been offside. But he left it.""When it comes to a goal kick, players can't be offside. This means that Toney's part in the play, where he challenged Ake without touching the ball, and Maupay running onto the ball, were both allowed. If Toney had touched the ball before it reached Maupay, then Maupay would have been considered offside because the ball wouldn't have come directly to him from the goal kick.'We've checked the club badge.

Most Barca fans will remember Rijkaard. The Dutch tactician was in charge at Barca between 2003 and 2008. After getting sacked he moved to Turkey where he managed Galatasaray for about a year before also being shown the door. The worry is that Rijkaard has not managed at the top level for more than 10 years. His last managerial job of note ended in 2013 when he was sacked by Saudi Arabia after being their coach for 14 matches. The 61-year-old has since abandoned football to start a thriving hospitality business. Thus, reports say he's reluctant to return to football management. Laporta is exploring the possibility of Rijkaard managing Barca alongside Dutch legend Marco Van Basten. Rijkaard led Barcelona to a Champions League and La Liga triumph in 2006. Laporta was enjoying his first spell as Barca president back then. 'Weakened him': Laporta slammed for doing one thing that forced Xavi to leave"

Man United's defence looks more solid and organised when Licha plays but, unfortunately, he won't be available in the coming few games or more. In his absence, Ten Hag is expected to rely on Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof or Jonny Evans at centre-back. Remember, the boss has previously preferred this combination over playing Maguire and Raphael Varane together. Martinez's injury spells more trouble for Varane as this could mean an extended spell on the bench for the Frenchman as well.

Quoted by the MEN, Neville noted Onana taking time in possession and he said: ""It just drives me crazy."" The reason behind that is to draw opponent attackers towards the ball and then spring a surprise counter-attack. In fact, minutes before Man United scored the winning goal via Scott McTominay, scores were tied 1-1. At that point, the former Red Devil added: ""There’s a bit of a lull in the stadium, the odd spark we have seen but it’s at both ends. ""Both teams just happy to waste time, it just does my head in.

Los Blancos had high hopes that Nacho would step up after season-ending ACL injuries to Eder Militao and David Alaba but that hasn't been the case. Instead, the Spaniard is perceived as a weak link in Real Madrid's otherwise concrete-tight defence. With Nacho starting at the heart of Real Madrid's defence, Los Blancos have conceded 12 goals in their last seven games. It's an alarming number for the title contenders in La Liga and the Champions League. Nacho has been caught napping in Madrid's last three games as Los Blancos failed to shut the back door and escaped by the skin of their teeth. A case in point is that the captain did not win a single ground or aerial duel in that game at Las Palmas and was culpable for the only goal scored by the hosts. Also, Real Madrid no longer trusts the centre-back partnership of Nacho and Antonio Rudiger as they are yet to keep a clean sheet when playing together this season. However, Real Madrid have decided they will not sign a new defender this January. The club expects Eder Militao to recover soon and return to helping the team before the end of the season. As for Nacho, he could well be allowed to leave when his contract ends in June. Spotted: Nacho's role in Las Palmas' first goal against Real Madrid since 2017"

He provided an assist to Gravenberch from there, also helping to cover for Trent defensively.Here is what Liverpool's XI would look like with Trent as a right-back and Conor as a right-winger.

Two ways Chelsea can line up with Karim Benzema - shown in pics,https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-17-two-ways-chelsea-can-line-up-with-karim-benzema-shown-in-pics/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Tribuna.com,2024-01-17T14:00:00.000Z,"Chelsea have recently been linked to a surprise move to sign Al Ittihad forward Karim Benzema on loan until the end of the season.The Blues are aiming for short-term options to fix their goal-scoring woes, with Nicolas Jackson and Armando Broja scoring a combined 10 goals this season.A deal to sign Benzema is not going to be easy. Al Ittihad are not ready to let him go that easily and Benzema has high wage demands of his own. Also signing a 36-year-old will be against the policy of signing younger players under Mauricio Pochettino.However, in football, you can never say never. Jordan Henderson has already reportedly agreed to leave Al Ettifaq after a frustrating loan spell and Benzema could be next in line.Going by that, here we look at the two ways Chelsea can line up with the French forward for the rest of the season.Option 1: Benzema up frontThe Ballon d’Or winner has excelled in his career in playing as a no.9. He is not the ordinary box striker, but someone who thrives in dropping deep to help link up plays before getting into the box to finish off moves.Having scored 432 goals in his career, Benzema could be exactly the kind of prolific striker Chelsea need to push for trophies and a possible top-4 or top-6 finish in the Premier League. He can also get more assists out of Cole Palmer and combine nicely with fellow Frenchman Christopher Nkunku.Option 2: In two-man forward linePochettino has opted against playing a two-man forward line in a 4-4-2 formation at Chelsea so far, but that can change with someone like Benzema. The ex-Real Madrid striker could play just ahead of Nkunku in a two-man forward line, with the wide areas being occupied by Palmer and Raheem Sterling. This could be for weaker oppositions or when Chelsea are in desperate need of goals and needs to go into an all-out-attack mode."

In terms of Ballon d'Or, this system has been changing over time.Many believe it was Wesley Sneijder who deserved the 2010 Ballon d'Or more. The Dutchman played a key role in Inter Milan's [managed by Jose Mourinho at the time] Champions League win and the Netherlands' World Cup final participation. However, the final top three was dominated by Barcelona stars and Messi won it for winning La Liga and scoring 47 goals across all competitions."

'I use that as motivation': Jurrien Timber opens up on 'frustrating' injury on Arsenal debut,https://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-02-07-jurrien-timber-opens-up-on-frustrating-injury-on-arsenal-debut/,Meghna @ 1819,ArsenalFC.com,2024-02-07T11:19:18.000Z,"Jurrien Timber picked up a heart-breaking ACL injury during his debut for Arsenal in the Premier League at the start of the season. Before that, he'd impressed in Arsenal's pre-season tour and even in the Community Shield win over Manchester City. He's nearing recovery now after undergoing surgery and even made the Gunners' Champions League squad. As he closes in on a much-awaited comeback, the centre-back told Arsenal club media: ""At some points, it’s been difficult because you’re not playing, and that’s the thing you love to do.""Sometimes you really want to join the team – when you are enjoying the game so much you really want to get down there and be part of it. ""That’s frustrating because sometimes it looks so amazing you want to be part of it. But I use that as motivation during my recovery. ""I see the boys a lot, at the training ground but also at the games, and that’s been good for me too."" Choosing to see the silver lining in this setback, Timber continued: ""These months will definitely make me stronger. It’s an opportunity for me to do well. ""So even though I’m not playing, I can take this moment to become stronger mentally, physically, and also to feel at home with this group of boys.""It’s an opportunity I’ve taken with both hands. I’ve had some more time to watch the team, see how we play, how I can fit in when I get on the pitch, so looking at the positives, I think there have been many.""

'Less heart attacks per match': Chelsea fans identify one key reason for sticking with Petrovic as Sanchez nears return,https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-19-less-heart-attacks-per-match-chelsea-fans-identify-one-key-reason-for-sticking-with-petro/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Reddit,2024-01-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Djordje Petrovic has proven himself more than capable of protecting the goal for Chelsea as the replacement for the injured Robert Sanchez.The young goalkeeper has kept three clean sheets in nine appearances this season and only conceded eight goals – producing a couple of really solid performances.He has proven himself to be more than capable of replacing Sanchez, who is reportedly on the verge of making his return from injury.However, some Chelsea fans want Petrovic to play on as the goalkeeper due to not just his shot-stopping ability, but also his passing style. Here’s what a few fans said on Reddit.Yslim1: “He plays it safe, good with his feet, can save shots, doesn't pass to enemy every game. That's all we need, no need any fancy keepers at the moment.”CFC0910: “Definitely less heart attacks (xHA) per match so I do prefer him over Sanchez. His shot stopping ability has been pretty impressive so far. Gotta see him against a top 6.”Homersanalglands: “I trust Petrovic more than i trust Sanchez. Sanchez is a good shot stopper but he has a mistake in him just like Kepa. I dont trust Sanchez when he comes off his lines and has to sweep the ball or his short distribution. He has good long ball distribution but his short distribution is horrible. Petrovic is a safer goalkeeper, his short distribution is great, long distribution is average. He is a good shot stopper and a good penality goalkeeper as well. I trust Petrovic more in goal, and i think the defenders does as well.”FB2986: “I hate for a guy to lose his job coming off injury.. but I don’t know how you can sit Petrovic now.. he’s been a solid calming presence unlike Sanchez who gets really erratic at times.”Micky09thedreamweaver: “The greatest compliment I can give Djordie is that I’m not absolutely terrified anymore when the ball goes near our GK - either when it’s passed back by one of our players or crossed in by one of the opposition.”Djordje Petrovic nominated for Premier League Save of the Month (video)'The decision is not on me': Petrovic talks Sanchez competition"

Both clubs explored the possibility of bringing Mbappe to England but quickly ended any interest after exploring the outrageous financial demands for transfer. With the big Premier League clubs taking a back seat on the Mbappe saga, Real Madrid now has the all-clear to go for the player. Reports say Los Blancos have been negotiating a contract with the Frenchman but their offers are yet to meet the player's satisfaction. Real Madrid were willing to break the bank for Mbappe in 2022 when he was free to leave PSG but he decided to renew for two more years. This year Madrid have taken a more frugal approach despite their interest in Mbappe still concrete. Mbappe may have only Real Madrid to choose from in if he leaves PSG in the summer as most clubs in Europe will be unwilling to smash their wage structure just to accommodate him."

"Hansi Flick at Barcelona: tactical profile, biggest strength & potential XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-06-hansi-flick-at-barcelona-tactical-profile-biggest-strength-potential-xis/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-02-06T15:35:00.000Z,"Hans-Dieter Flick, the manager who has been giving Barca fans their worst nightmares in recent years, may soon become their saviour as he reportedly takes Spanish courses to coach in La Liga.Here is what Barca may look like under the German if we consider his best managerial spell, the one at Bayern Munich.***Hansi would want his team to constantly press the opposition high and win the ball back as soon as possible. Flick is surely about control, with his Bayern side averaging 60.2 per cent possession in 2020/21, but not as much as Xavi, whose Barca average around 65 per cent in 2023/24.Unlike at Quique Setien’s Barca (average possession of 74 per cent), there is no passing just for the sake of passing — Flick’s team would often attempt crosses and long balls from deep positions as the main idea is to generate a lot of chances and feed forwards with balls.Flick’s favoured formation is 4-2-3-1. Barca are already well prepared to line up this way on a permanent basis: Xavi used this set-up at the beginning of the season when he fielded Oriol Romeu and Frenkie de Jong in the same line-up — it worked very well before the Dutchman got sidelined.Undoubtedly, Flick excels at unlocking his team’s attacking potential. Flick’s Bayern scored a whopping 260 goals in just 86 games, only failing to score once. Robert Lewandowski felt particularly comfortable under Flick, finding the net 83 times in just 71 appearances.Naturally, the downside of Flick’s aggressive tactics is defending. Hansi’s risky approach with a high defensive line often cost his Bayern team as they were hit in transition after losing possession in the build-up. This resulted in Flick's side conceding slightly above a goal per game.It’s interesting what roster Hansi would like to have at his disposal, given Barca’s delicate financial situation. First, let’s think about a potential eleven without any new signings.Line-up 1 Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; De Jong, Gavi; Yamal, Gundogan, Pedri; Lewandowski.Two attack-minded wing-backs (who would naturally make the team’s wing defending more vulnerable), tireless defence-minded midfield and a great attacking support for Robert Lewandowski — something that worked very well at Bayern.Line-up 2Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, De Ligt, Balde; Kimmich, Thiago; Yamal, Gundogan, Pedri; Lewandowski.If given the chance, Flick will probably want his defence and midfield to be strengthened. Matthijs de Ligt is still said to be dreaming of joining Barca and would replace one of the underperforming centre-backs; Joshua Kimmich would be Barca’s long-term solution for the defensive midfield; Thiago Alcantara is the one Flick actually called his ‘favourite player’ before Germany faced Spain at the 2022 World Cup.It would be refreshing to see this Barca side in action.❓ Would you like to see Hansi Flick coaching Barca next season?

The 45-year-old holds the record for the most World Cup goals, with 16 spread across four competitions, from 2002 to 2014.Quoted by Sport Bild, Klose said: ""I had predicted at least 20 to 25 goals for Harry [this season], but even that was too low. What impresses me most is his shooting technique. If I had only five per cent of that, I would probably have scored 30 World Cup goals!""""He is so precise and skilful when it comes to finishing. It's just like a tennis player when he serves. What the tennis player does with his wrist, Harry Kane does with his foot and ankle.""""He always has the same posture, but he swings his foot differently. The goalkeepers cannot predict where the shot will go. It’s wonderful.""Kane might break Klose's World Cup record before he retires. The 30-year-old England captain has eight goals from two tournaments, winning the Golden Boot in 2018.

Haaland believes he might've won the award if he was playing for a big club like Real Madrid. A case in point is Karim Benzema, who undeniably won the Ballon d'Or as a Real Madrid player for the 2021/22 season. While Haaland is keen on joining Real Madrid, Florentino Perez's main interest remains Kylian Mbappe. Madrid are hoping to sign the Frenchman in the summer as a free agent. However, if Mbappe dribbles Florentino again and signs a new deal with PSG, Real Madrid are tipped to go all out for Haaland. The final fee for the Norwegian could be closer to €100m than €200m.

""We were obviously hoping for a stumble from our rivals to help us close the gap. It could have happened on Sunday but in a very clear way that match at the Bernabeu was re-refereed by the VAR and all the decisions that were made were contrary to those that the referee had made,"" Laporta said in a dinner on Tuesday night. ""I believe that the VAR, which is an instrument that comes to help referees, is becoming, due to the misuse that is being made of it, a problem. And I say it and I don't like to play victimhood, but it is a commitment that we have with justice and sportsmanship. It is a commitment that the club has when it comes to recognizing the complicated job that referees have. ""For me, the role of referee is the most difficult in the world of football after scoring goals, if you ask me. Man, we are seeing that an instrument that had to help them, the VAR, is not helping them and has been kidnapped. ""VAR has been misused based on the pressure that our rival [Real Madrid] are exerting continuously and constantly, which is no longer punctual but from now on. These pressures have been taking place for a long time and are bearing fruit. Because the decisions are all favourable to this team,"" Laporta concluded. Since the game between Real Madrid and Almeria, Barcelona simply haven't stopped talking and levelling serious and unfounded accusations either. However, it is Barcelona who are currently under intense investigation by La Liga and the Spanish government over a scandal of bribing referees for many years. Real Madrid pointed that fact out recently. Real Madrid TV slams Xavi's comments on referee bias: ‘For 20 years his club has been paying referees’"

Here's how are players faredJoselu - 9Today was Joselu's day to show Madridistas just what he's all about. The 33-year-old was a destructive force for that Getafe defence all game and was duly rewarded with a well-taken brace. The Spaniard could've added an assist if Vinicius was a little more clinical with his cutback. Bellingham - 8One thing Jude Bellingham will never be accused of in his career is a lack of effort. The midfielder put in a shift and was too powerful for Getafe's athletic midfield. He didn't score but he also didn't lose the ball, misplace a pass or dibbled past. It was a top performance by Jude once again. Vazquez - 7.5Lucas Vazquez started the party for Real Madrid with that sublime cross for Joselu to open the scoring. Some Real Madrid fans couldn't believe he had that in his locker. Vazquez continued to probe and could've added two more assists to his name if Joselu was luckier. It was a good performance from the Spaniard. Modric - 7Luka Modric continues to age like fine wine. Once again the Croatian showed his quality as he played as the number 8 in Real Madrid's four-man midfield. He barely gave the ball away and set his team on the move with his incredible passing range. Lunin - 7Perhaps Lunin has cemented his place as Real Madrid's first-choice goalie. He was neat and tidy in goal against Getafe and smothered everything that came his way. Madrid's defence did not panic knowing their goal was secured by safe hands from Ukraine. Vinicius - 5The Brazilian was not at his clinical best today. In the first half, Vini missed a huge chance when put one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He was easily shut down by the Getafe defence. He gets a rating of 5 for his sublime assist for Joselu's second goal. It's what top players do, even on their off day they still manage to affect the game somehow. Other players.

Given his poor injury record, Martial is expected to take longer than that to recover fully. He's only appeared in 13 Premier League games this season, mostly off the bench. In other words, it looks like Martial may not play for Man United again until his contract expires this summer. Considering he earns £250,000 a week, that's an expensive non-playing player to have on your books. But why are the Red Devils simply not terminating Martial's contract as they did with Cristiano Ronaldo? We saw a few of these queries from fans on social media as well as from our users. To clear it up, both parties (in this case Man United and Martial) need to agree to terminate his contract. His agent has, unfortunately, confirmed that Martial is going nowhere this month and will see out his contract at Old Trafford. In Ronaldo's case, the Portuguese superstar himself wished to leave. Thus, unless Martial and his camp are willing, Man United have their hands tied in this situation.

Real Madrid are yet to agree to Mbappe's demands and that explains why the player is reluctant to publicly announce he will leave PSG. Mbappe currently earns €72m gross per year at PSG and is guaranteed a loyalty bonus worth €130m if he extends his contract with the Parisians. Mbappe forgave PSG €70m of that money to stay back at PSG without extending his contract last summer. But PSG will pay the rest if he doesn't leave in June. What it shows is that Mbappe is willing to take a pay cut to join Real Madrid but even at that he would be earning a stupendous amount of money if Florentino Perez meets his demands. It remains to be seen what Real Madrid's final decision will be in the end. No matter what they decide, getting Mbappe will cost Real Madrid a lot of money. 2 big clubs pull out of Mbappe race over the same reason — sources"

I am not aware of any interest from AC Milan or Chelsea.“They are giant clubs and it would be a pleasure, but I have no knowledge of anything. As a child you dream of playing there.”Irrespective of Duran’s comments, this deal doesn’t really make sense for Chelsea. The 20-year-old striker has been a back-up for Ollie Watkins at Villa this season, not starting any Premier League matches and only scoring two goals in 14 appearances in the competition.Despite showing some promising signs, the youngster is still green and has only made 35 appearances for Villa so far – so there are no indications that he is the one to unlock Chelsea’s frontline and barge in more goals than Armando Broja or Nicolas Jackson.'Still waiting to understand': Fabrizio Romano reveals Chelsea plans on striker transfer"

Because he's likely to mop the floor with you or simply leave you for dead with his blistering pace more often than not. Leao is that good.

He's won the league once and netted 49 goals plus 44 assists in his 190 appearances. All that while being just 24 years old. According to FootMercato, Leao has told close pals he's reached the end of a cycle in Italy and intends to move abroad to win more titles. Barcelona might've been alerted to Leao's availability given their lack of depth on the left. Ferran Torres would rather play through the middle and Joao Felix hasn't genuinely done enough to convince Xavi and his coaching staff.

6 players Ten Hag has feuded with since joining Man United,https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-18-6-players-ten-hag-has-feuded-with-since-joining-man-united/,Meghna @ 1819,Tribuna.com,2024-01-18T17:08:00.000Z,"Erik ten Hag is unafraid to lay down the law at Manchester United so far, having had public clashes with some of the biggest names in football. It could be argued that the club desperately needed a hardline disciplinarian like Ten Hag. Player power has been shockingly on the rise at Old Trafford over the years. Since taking charge, Ten Hag has famously fallen out with several names. Let's begin from where it all started. Zidane IqbalThe former Academy player was a huge fan favourite but his training performances didn't impress Ten Hag one bit. Erik even called Iqbal 'f***ing rubbish' for not keeping the ball on the floor enough. Iqbal was not given a single minute of action the following season and he ended up joining FC Utrecht. Cristiano RonaldoThe biggest name on the list, Ronaldo famously called out Ten Hag for not giving him enough respect. Cristiano was not happy about being benched as he wished to play regularly. Erik had other ideas as he wanted to give everyone a chance. Few could argue that was the case though, as the Portuguese superstar's behaviour towards the end of his second spell had become intolerable. He refused to acknowledge fans, stormed out before games ended and no one can forget that Piers Morgan interview. Having threatened to undo Ten Hag's efforts at team-building, Ronaldo's contract was swiftly terminated. Marcus Rashford This might not exactly be a feud but it's worth including here to show not everything has to end negatively. Rashford was benched for a couple of games for showing up late to training sessions. Although Marcus' form hasn't been the best, he did what the others failed to do - he took it in his stride and apologised. The boss isn't one to carry things over as he quickly reinstated Rashford into the team again. Jadon SanchoNo one thought Sancho would leave Man United for something so trivial as gaming too much at 4am when he first signed for a fee of £73 million. Sadly, that's the downward slope his career went in. He was not focused enough on football causing a decline in his training output. Ten Hag called him out for underperforming, prompting Sancho to accuse him of 'scapegoating' and also called him a liar. Since then, Sancho refused to apologise and was exiled from the first-team as a result. He's now rejoined Borussia Dortmund on loan. Raphael VaraneAnother one unhappy with his game time, Varane and Ten Hag were at war of words earlier this season. The centre-back has been injured most of the campaign but he made a comeback in November. At the time, Erik preferred to play Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, citing tactical reasons. Varane was not pleased with being benched and confronted Ten Hag, which reportedly didn't end well. Earning £340,000-a-week in wages, the Frenchman is an expensive option to have on the bench. Anthony MartialAnd the latest to join the list, Martial has had it coming for a long time. After struggling to deliver the goods on the field, it's no surprise his training performances have drawn criticism. Now, it appears Ten Hag has ordered Martial to train alone until he regains the standards required of the first-team. It's unclear what the striker's future holds, with his current contract expiring at the end of this season."

"Roberto De Zerbi at Barcelona: tactical profile, biggest strength & potential XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-07-roberto-de-zerbi-at-barcelona-tactical-profile-biggest-strength-potential-xis/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-02-07T21:00:00.000Z,"Three years ago, Roberto De Zerbi was trying to make a career in the unforgiving frosty cold weather of Ukraine. The Italian successfully installed his philosophy at Shakhtar Donetsk who went on to win the Ukrainian Super Cup. Thus, De Zerbi became the first Italian manager to win a title in Ukraine. After war broke out between Ukraine and Russia, De Zerbi didn’t find it difficult to land a decent job in the Premier League as Brighton’s gaffer. Fast forward to 2024, De Zerbi is now one of Europe's most talked about managers. So much so that he’s being linked with the top job in Barcelona and Liverpool, with Xavi and Jurgen Klopp declaring they have run out of energy.De Zerbi’s rise to prominence in such a short time stems from what his fine work at Brighton. The 44-year-old guided the Seagulls to a sixth-placed finish last season — their highest-ever finish in the Premier League. It also guaranteed them a place in Europe for the first time.De Zerbi’s style Brighton has maintained their seductive brand of football playing their preferred 3-4-2-1 formation under Zerbi this season. It’s a system that utilizes all 11 players on the pitch with their goalkeeper averaging 50 touches per game. It’s why Brighton boasts 64% possession per match — by comparison, only Man City (66%) commands more possession of the ball than Brighton in the Premier League. De Zerbi’s team have perfected the art of building up from the back, finding and exploiting gaps in their opponent’s midfield and defence. It’s why Brighton rarely struggle to create scoring chances, regardless of opponent. The Seagulls have created 48 big chances in the league this season alone. De Zerbi’s team records 11.98 shots per game with an xG (expected goals) tally of 1.71 per game. That’s almost identical to Xavi’s Barca with an average of 13.35 shots and an xG of 1.98 per match. You don’t need reminding who has the better tools to perform.  What’s more, De Zerbi’s team also excels when it comes to taking most of the chances they create. Only six teams in the Premier League have scored more goals this term than Brighton who average 1.8 goals per game. One big weakness in De Zerbi’s teamIt’s their defence. De Zerbi’s team concede a lot of goals when they’re hit in transition. It’s the natural drawback to playing out from the back or keeping a high line. We noticed that Brighton’s defence have made 7 errors leading to goals this term. They suffer when facing physical teams who set up in a low block and willingly surrender possession. Thus, Brighton concedes 1.65 goals in the league and can only boast of two league clean sheets after 23 games this season. The only legislation for that anomaly is that De Zerbi’s Brighton usually outscores their opponents, plus their brand football is a joy to watch. De Zerbi has been turning lemons into lemonades at Brighton and there’s no bigger club for such an ingenious tactician to do exactly that than Barca. The Blaugrana have continued to struggle with Financial Fair Play restrictions after plunging into a €1.2 billion debt. Still, they recently won La Liga and boast one of the most talented teams in Europe. De Zerbi could work wonders with such a team if handed the reins. Provided Laporta and Deco can agree to make it happen, here are two ways De Zerbi can line up at Barca with his favourite formation. Lineup 1Ter Stegen; Christensen, Araujo, Kounde; Balde, De Jong, Gundogan, Cancelo; Pedri, Yamal; Lewandowski It’s conceivable that De Zerbi would start with the same three centrebacks Xavi successfully used in winning La Liga two seasons ago. Two flying full-backs would give the team the needed overload down the flanks. In midfield, Barca already have the tools De Zerbi needs. A tireless workhorse like De Jong, and creators like Gundo and Pedri who can drift into forward positions to help the team. Lineup 2Ter Stegen; Christensen, Araujo, Kounde; Balde, Gross, De Jong, Gavi; Felix, Yamal; LewandowskiDe Zerbi is likely to sanction a signing or two to further strengthen his team. Like most coaches who thrive on possession dominance, he’d be looking at midfielders to bring in. The easiest and cheapest from Brighton would be Pascal Gross. A veteran just like Gundogan but still a consistent and versatile performer. What stops this Barca team from bullying Europe and winning the Champions League?❓ Would you like to see De Zerbi coaching Barca next season?

The German tactician is keen on taking over at Barca in June after leaving his role as Germany's head coach late last year. Flick showed his admiration for Spain when he was spotted enjoying his summer vacation in the country back in 2023. Diario AS reports that Flick came within touching distance of being named Barca's head coach after the club fired Ronald Koeman in 2021. However, he rejected the offer from Laporta following a video call. Barca chose to go with Xavi that year with the former midfielder delivering two titles in about a year and a half. But Xavi's third season as Barca coach has seen some serious shaking with his team practically stumbling out of the title race while watching themselves get knocked out of the Copa Del Rey. In January, Barca were beaten in the Super Cup final by Real Madrid. The reverse was the case last year.Hence, Xavi announced his resignation from Barca with a new coach expected to take over at the end of the season.

Towards the end of 2023, the football star departed Saudi Arabia without offering any explanations. Adding to the mystery, he deleted his Instagram account. Recently, Benzema was spotted in Mauritius in the company of his former wife, Chloé De Launay.The pictures suggest that this rendezvous goes beyond a casual catch-up. It seems like Benzema is up to something intriguing in his personal life. So get to know Chloé De Launay!                                   Chloé was born in 1991 on La Réunion, a French overseas region on an island in the Indian Ocean, 700 km from Madagascar and about 10,000 km from Paris.The woman is three years younger than Benzema: she is now 32 years old.                                     Chloé and Karim met in 2008. The striker was still a goalscorer at Lyon at the time and had no idea that he would win the UCL five times. Already in Madrid, the couple gave birth to a daughter - Melia.But about a year after Melia was born, Chloé and Karim's relationship came to a halt: the two separated.                                       In 2015, Karim began a wild journey of love. The footballer had a fleeting affair with singer Rihanna, and at the end of 2016, Benzema became the husband of Cora Gauthier, with whom he has a son, Ibrahim.But here too, the Frenchman was not blessed with family happiness for long: in 2020 he briefly returned to Chloe, which resulted in the birth of his son Nouri. In 2022, he began a relationship with Jordan Ozuna and became a father for the fourth time. And now Benzema is going on a nice vacation with his first wife. History goes in circles, doesn't it?                                     Karim Benzema could return to former club amid Saudi exit links"

They [Saudis] haven't made it easy for us. In fact, many footballers are unhappy.""But whatever, we work every day and hopefully little by little things change, because for them it's also a new thing to have important players from Europe. Maybe they need to be a little more serious.""When asked what exactly is missing for him, Laporte clarified: ""It's daily routines. The life for them [Saudis]... they take it lightly. They don't care about ultimatums. You agree on one thing and then they don't accept it after you've already negotiated.""I only speak from my experience and I don't know how others feel. To be honest, we didn't really come here for football, and many are happy with this, but I also want to see beyond that. I expected something different in terms of comfort of life but I end up spending three hours a day in the car because of traffic in Riyadh.""Despite the interview being done in Spanish, a language Laporte has mastery of, the footballer then claimed on social media that ""not everything I said is what I think and at the moment I wasn't thinking a lot"" and that ""the translation is not good into other languages"". Laporte was part of the footballing bonanza in the summer of 2023 when he swapped Man City for being teammates with Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr.However, mere months after the giant spending spree, cracks are beginning to emerge. If Laporte has only voiced his concerns, Jordan Henderson left the league altogether to join Ajax and won't get much of his Saudi money.One person who seems to be enjoying the experience is Steven Gerrard. Although his Ettifaq haven't won in nine games in a row, he is set to sign a contract extension.Cristiano Ronaldo may be another one who loves life in Saudi Arabia as he's just received another batch of awards from Globe Soccer."

He made a great block to deny a Villa chance right after Man United opened the scoring. He immediately saved another one just one minute later. After the break, Onana once again sprung into action to deny Villa, who were also not clinical enough with their finishing. Onana should have kept a clean sheet in this one for his consistency at making saves - something he's been criticised for.

This legal battle is distinct from Everton's recent 10-point deduction for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, as City's case involves different circumstances.According to reports from the Daily Mail, an independent panel will handle the matter, with the trial tentatively set for late autumn 2024. Currently, statements are being gathered from witnesses and will continue until next spring. Premier League chief Richard Masters has confirmed that a date has been set for City's case, though details remain undisclosed.Speculation suggests a potential verdict by summer 2025, but delays are possible, especially with anticipated appeals from both sides. Unlike the UEFA case, where a two-year Champions League ban was overturned, City won't have the option to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The official Premier League website will be the platform for the initial announcement of the trial's outcome. The football world eagerly awaits the resolution of this high-profile legal saga.Why Man City might be banished from Champions League next season — it has nothing to do with FFP"

What can Ferran Torres improve on to become world class?,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-18-what-can-ferran-torres-improve-on-to-become-world-class/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-01-18T13:45:00.000Z,"Is it possible that Ferran Torres ever becomes good enough to win the Ballon d'Or? Maybe we're aiming too high up the tree. A proper question would be, can Ferran ever become a world-class forward? Good examples of world class forwards include players like Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, Vinicius Jr and Lautaro Martinez. Barca were hoping they got one when they paid €55m to get Ferran from Manchester City for the 23-year-old. That hasn't been the case. After two full years, the Blaugrana have only gotten 21 goals for the money they spent on the Spaniard. Even if you add the 12 assists he's registered so far, it's still a far cry from what you'll expect from an expensive forward after 98 games. Let's discuss what Ferran could change to sit on the table of Europe's elite forwards. FinishingFerran can do so much better with his shot accuracy and finishing. In many instances when he gets into excellent positions his finishing ability often lets him down. The Spaniard can hardly be faulted for his work rate as he often puts in the effort any coach would require, but he just doesn't bury it when everyone thinks he would. It's probably why Ferran is not expected to score so many goals even when he plays well. Stats show he's behind Every Barca forward but Lamine in terms of expected goals (xG). Even Gundugan who's a midfielder is expected to score more. PositioningFerran's positioning on the pitch often raises several questions. He drifts inside the striker's position when he doesn't need to and seldom provides the overload Barca desperately needs when he plays either on the left or right. Some don't believe he's better as a number 9 and I agree. The numbers don't lie just 2 goals in his career when playing centre-forward. In one episode during Barca's win against Osasuna in the Super Cup semi-final, Ferran's positioning was called out by an analyst who wondered why he doesn't move into the channels to provide an outlet for Barca like he was asked to do. Ferran drifts into the ST position. He should be widePerhaps Xavi could coach this blatant flaw by shouting at him from the sidelines. If Ferran improves his positing his goal contributions will improve massively. Even if he doesn't get to score, his assists stat would be better off, say even more than Raphinha who has seven assists despite struggling so much with injuries. Over to you, what do you think Ferran needs to improve on? 5 players at Barca whose performances could get Xavi sacked"

""I think he/she should be told to get the f*** back out there… night."" On many occasions, Zinchenko and White went further ahead to break Forest's defence. They eventually succeeded as Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka scored two for the Gunners. Arsenal were unable to keep a clean sheet, thanks to Taiwo Awoniyi's late goal, which led to a chaotic ending. However, the win has now pushed Arsenal up to second place in the Premier League standings.

The 33-year-old is Barca's absolute best playmaker who consistently drops masterclasses week in, week out.Just look at this crazy difference in expected assisted goals [xAG] in all competitions this season:1. Ilkay Gundogan - 9.22. Lamine Yamal - 5.12. Raphinha - 5.14. Joao Cancelo - 4.75. Robert Lewandowski - 4.0Gundogan actually has his best-ever assist tally in Europe's top five leagues – nine. And there are four months of the season left.Lamine YamalAlthough Deco says the 16-year-old plays so much due to first-team injuries, the teenager proves he absolutely deserves the game time he receives.Lamine is surely Barca's most creative attacker – it's not just about created chances but also about the ability to beat opponents on the wing and carry the ball forward from deeper positions. He fills Blaugrana's games with joy only players like Leo Messi, Ronaldinho and Neymar used to give us.Lamine Yamal reveals watching one player's comps for inspiration – not MessiInigo MartinezDespite making just 12 appearances for Barcelona so far, the experienced centre-back surprisingly proves to be the best choice in his position.One trait makes Inigo absolutely invaluable for Xavi – his ability to send quality long balls into the opposition half. The 32-year-old created multiple chances this way while also looking solid and aggressive enough at the back. When he's fit, he is a game changer.Ferran TorresFerran's resurrection is truly impressive. He is possibly the Barca player with the healthiest mental state this season.The 23-year-old has covered every position in attack this term and registered 15 goal contributions in all competitions. Goalscoring-wise, he is still far from the numbers of Kylian Mbappe or Erling Haaland, but his goal-per-game rate looks decent.Frenkie de JongWe almost never see the Dutchman flop in a single game. He consistently looks great and crucial to Barca's midfield.This season, the 26-year-old is among La Liga's best players in the number of through balls and expected assists while expectedly registering plenty of progressive passes and runs."
5 budget transfer options from AFCON Barca should consider as their next signing,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-29-5-budget-options-from-afcon-barca-might-consider-as-their-next-signing/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-01-29T18:58:00.000Z,"Barcelona have sent their scouts to the Africa Cup of Nations to watch the likes of Pape Matar Sarr and Ousmane Diomande closely. The problem is these players all are beyond Barca's financial reach — unless Joan Laporta somehow finds another lever to trigger. So bargain-hunting is a more realistic option for the club.We've come up with five quality budget options Deco could go for even in the final days of the January transfer window or in the summer.Aboubakary Koita, MauritaniaDoubts over the futures of Joao Felix and Ansu Fati will almost certainly force Barca to look for a left winger in the summer. Nico Williams was supposed to be one, but even an otherwise affordable release clause of €50m is beyond Barca's reach.Aboubakary Koita could be a decent alternative. The 25-year-old has 11 goals in 21 matches for Sint-Truiden, a mid-table side of the Belgian top tier. He is the league leader for successful take-ons, fouls drawn and progressive carries, which perfectly describes his style of play.Koita’s tactical transformation over the years is really impressive. This is his first season as a left winger; previously, he used to play as a wide midfielder on each side while also trying his luck in midfield. Reminds us of Bukayo Saka’s evolution.Shortly after making his debut for Mauritania, Koita scored the first goal for the national team, helping them advance to their first-ever AFCON knockouts after spending decades at the bottom of FIFA rankings.Koita’s current deal with Sint-Truiden expires in July 2025 which means he could be available at a low cost this summer. His estimated value is €5m.Logan Costa, Cape VerdeJust like the entire Cape Verde team, Logan Costa has been one of the biggest discoveries of this AFCON. Although his side conceded against Ghana and Egypt in the group stage, the 22-year-old was rock-solid on both occasions, recording six tackles and 10 clearances in two matches combined.What makes Costa a potentially perfect fit for Barca is the way he progresses with the ball forward – he reminds us of Andreas Christensen in this respect. He’s not afraid to do it even against more high-profile opponents. His bravery against Egypt led to him providing two key passes.The centre-back plays for Toulouse who are famous for their AI-driven approach to recruiting players, so Costa isn't a random Joe. Last season, the Cape Verdean helped his team to the French Cup scoring two in the final.Logan’s contract with Toulouse ends in 2026, with the estimated price standing at €5m.Lamine Camara, SenegalAnother priority position to strengthen is the defensive midfield. Barca’s desperation almost forced them to sign Pep Guardiola’s outcast Kalvin Phillips, but even that move ended up being infeasible.Senegal’s rising star Lamine Camara is the one to watch. The player joined Metz from Generation Foot – the Senegalese side are strategic partners with the Ligue 1 club providing them with top-quality prospects, Sadio Mane being the best example. Camara now averages more tackles, interceptions and blocks per 90 minutes than most midfielders in Europe’s top 5 leagues. Despite all that, he is more than just a ball winner: like Barca’s other target Aleix Garcia, the youngster can cover every position in midfield, succeeding as an attacking midfielder in the national team. He scored twice in Senegal’s opening AFCON match against Gambia, the second goal being an absolute stunner.Camara's current deal with Metz expires in 2026 and his estimated value is set at €4m.Kamory Doumbia, Mali‘We’ve got our own Jude Bellingham at home’ – that’s what Joan Laporta can say if he lands the Malian one day.I’m not even exaggerating. Stat database Fbref names the Englishman as the one who's most similar to the 20-year-old — largely thanks to his immense defensive contribution for a midfielder who bangs goals here and there.His goalscoring instincts aside, Doumbia’s strong attributes include dribbling and playmaking. He has delivered five key passes in his first three AFCON matches, two of which led to assists.Since 1988, only 17 players have ever received a 10/10 from L'Equipe, notorious for their harsh match ratings. The list has the likes of Leo Messi, Erling Haaland, Robert Lewandowski, and... Kamory Doumbia. This happened when the Malian hit four goals past Lorient in 2023/24 while playing as a central midfielder.Kamory’s contract with Reims (he’s currently on loan at Brest) expires in 2025, so a low-cost deal may be possible in the summer. His estimated cost is €2m.Jesus Owono, Equatorial GuineaMany Barca fans are getting tired of Inaki Pena’s inconsistency. Time to get a new backup for Marc-Andre ter Stegen?Jesus Owono is the real deal. After winning the Man of the Match against Nigeria, the Equatorial Guinea representative went on to deliver an assist (his SECOND this season) against Guinea-Bissau and keep a clean sheet against the tournament hosts Ivory Coast.Born in Equatorial Guinea, the 22-year-old began to play football in Spain, where he has spent most of his life. Owono is a second choice for Alaves in La Liga but starts in Copa del Rey, where he's kept three clean sheets in three matches, including one against Real Betis.Owono is among the players with the most saves made and the highest save percentage at this AFCON. He’s clearly in the form of his life – with his contract expiring this summer, Barca should act quickly.Which of these players should Barca consider? Would you recommend any other underrated African players to the club?"

If one has noticed, Dalot has been one of the most prominent speakers in post-match engagements this season. He's also been doing an unusual number of interviews with club media. These interviews are usually distributed equally among the team as seen in previous seasons. The MEN understand that the staff believes Dalot is being 'overtaxed' but they don't have a choice.

But before we jump into the tips, remember, pokies are a game of chance, and there's no surefire way to guarantee a win. Responsible gambling is key - always play within your means and for fun.1. Understand the Game: Pokies aren't just about pushing buttons. Each game has its unique paytable and rules. Familiarise yourself with these before you start. Knowing what each symbol means and the various paylines can significantly enhance your experience.2. Start Small: Especially if you're a newbie, start with smaller bets. This approach lets you get the hang of the game without risking too much dough. Plus, it extends your playtime, which is half the fun!3. Eye on the Prize - Progressive Jackpots: If you're dreaming of the big win, progressive jackpots are where it's at. These pokies pool money over a network, creating massive jackpots. Remember, though, the odds are longer, and you often need to play the maximum bet to qualify.4. Take Advantage of Bonuses: Many Aussie pubs, clubs, and casinos offer bonuses or free spins on pokies. These can be a great way to get extra play without additional cost. However, always read the terms and conditions – there’s no such thing as free money!5. Know When to Say Ta-Ta: The biggest secret to pokies? Knowing when to walk away. Set a budget before you start and stick to it. If you hit a nice win, consider pocketing your initial stake and playing only with your winnings.6. Play for Fun, Not to Make Money: Remember, pokies are a form of entertainment, not a way to make a living. Enjoy the thrill, the lights, the sounds, and the excitement, but don't chase losses or play with the rent money.And lastly, if you or someone you know is struggling with gambling, don't hesitate to seek help. Responsible gambling is the best bet you'll ever make. So, spin those reels responsibly, and who knows? Lady Luck might just be on your side down under!Choosing the Best Online Pokies Australia Real Money Site for YouSelecting the ideal online pokies Australia real money sites doesn't happen by accident; it requires a keen eye for detail and understanding your personal preferences.

Barca still owes Ajax money for De Jong transfer — what it takes to keep Frenkie revealed,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-14-barca-still-owe-ajax-money-for-de-jong-transfer-what-it-takes-to-keep-frenkie-revealed/,Kingsley_,RAC1,2024-02-14T14:59:01.000Z,"In a surprise revelation on Wednesday, RAC1 claims Barcelona still owes Ajax €30m of the €86m transfer fee agreed for the sale of Frenkie De Jong back in 2019. Besides their big debt to Ajax, Barca are also struggling to keep De Jong on their books with his current (€18m net) salary. Over the next two seasons, Barcelona must pay the Dutchman a staggering €77m in wages just to keep him. De Jong is expected to receive close to €30m in deferred wages this season alone. It's no secret that the midfielder has deferred his wages many times to help the club. Now it's time for Barca to pay up. Barca have come up with an ingenious plan to resolve the situation — extend the player's contract (until 2029) and amortise his salary over the remaining five years. But for that to happen, De Jong must agree to the plan and take a wage cut. Barca are offering De Jong a new base salary of €15m per season (net) which still has him as their top earner. But it's a considerable figure the club can live with. As it stands De Jong and his entourage are yet to come to the negotiating table, with Barca putting pressure. It is believed that Barca will listen to offers for the star midfielder if nothing is agreed by the summer. Barca reportedly believes they can raise a lot of money by selling him but that's only their plan B. Barca submit final offer to Frenkie De Jong (reliability: 5 stars)"

What Ronald Araujo did while Robert Lewandowski and Eric Bailly were at loggerheads,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-31-what-ronald-araujo-did-while-robert-lewandowski-and-eric-bailly-were-at-loggerheads/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-01-31T15:11:17.000Z,"Ronald Araujo's actions make Robert Lewandowski's altercation with Eric Bailly even more comical.While the two were bullying each other, the Uruguayan picked the ball up on the sly and went into fifth gear.Ironically, it was Bailly to send the ball into his own net minutes later. Sadly, this wasn't enough for Barcelona to win the game as they went on to concede three more goals afterwards.Barca lost to Villarreal 5-3 that night."
'Stop this cringe': Spurs fans react to recent 'hard to watch' video on Tottenham's X account,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-20-stop-this-cringe-spurs-fans-react-to-recent-hard-to-watch-video-on-tottenhams-x-account/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Spurs Official,2024-01-20T07:32:16.000Z,"Spurs are riding high on good vibes, surprising many with their unexpected title challenge under Ange Postecoglou. The team has welcomed back players like Mickey van den Ven and Cristiano Romero, who rejoined after recovering from injuries.Adding to the positive momentum, Tottenham has bolstered its squad in the transfer market with the acquisitions of Timo Werner and Radu Dragusin.However, some Spurs fans think their club need some improvement in content content-making department, calling the recent video on Tottenham's X account cringy. The video featured players like Maddison and Richarlison arriving at the club's training ground. They were asked about the most famous person in their phone contacts and encouraged to FaceTime them, resulting in some awkward conversations.When Maddison shared that his top contact was Robbie Williams, he seemed a bit hesitant to give the pop sensation a call.Maddison then did try to ring but failed. He said: ""Probably not, he’s in Australia.""Richarlison said that his most famous contact was Neymar, but he absolutely refused to give him a call.Richarlison said: ""Now? Maybe it’s not possible. Brazil is the morning now, he might be asleep. Neymar has five numbers, he changes it every time.""Some fans were quick to criticise the video, calling it cringy. Most supporters didn't like footballers being put in awkward situations. Alex: ""I cringed during this.

The Best of Sports Memes and Breaking News In 2023,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-02-16-the-best-of-sports-memes-and-breaking-news-in-2023/,Alex,,2024-02-16T08:56:24.000Z,"We are already more than halfway through the 2023-2024 sport season and have noticed that the season has been nothing short of a meme goldmine. Events such as Aaron Rodgers's unexpected injury and Josh Allen's audacious hail-mary passes are visible. In 2024, it’s time to sum up the major sports events of 2023 and the memes that appeared over the last season. Sports Memes and Breaking News In 2023 Do you always want to know what is the biggest news in sports today? Well, you need to stay tuned. But if you want to keep your finger on the pulse of all things gaming, you also need streaming services. One is not enough, given the power outages and regional restrictions. If you had asked me what is the best source for sports news, I would have hesitated. For me it's Reddit, but if you prefer more official sources then ESPN. To follow the sport, you will need a VPN. This way you can access all games, including local ones. Just be sure to choose a no-logs VPN so that your data can't be leaked, queried by the government, or sold. The first one that comes to mind is VeePN; it works well with streaming content and the service’s security is at the highest level. Moreover, VeePN has thousands of servers around the world and has a free trial period. #1 Taylor Swift invades the NFL Travis Kelce's notoriety in the NFL world soared to new heights once he began dating a global pop sensation. The Chiefs' formidable tight end was well-known, but pair him with an international music icon, and you've got an unprecedented fusion of sports and pop culture. Fans typically focused on chart-topping hits were suddenly breaking down football strategies while high-profile spats, like Aaron Rodgers' attempt at a vaccine-related controversy, failed to overshadow Kelce's newfound fame. Amidst more televised celebrations of Swift's than game replays, one might view the relationship skeptically. However, it appears genuine, with both Kelce and the pop star seemingly enjoying a pleasant union. This crossover has not only maintained its momentum but also enlarged the fanbase for both the NFL and the music industry—a serendipitous win-win for the sports and entertainment sectors. #2 Winning isn’t everything In a display of athletic brilliance, the Raiders secured an impressive victory against the Chargers as they dominated the scoreboard with 42 points in the opening half of Week 15. Although they finished the game with a grand total of 63 points, the remarkable feat of scoring 42 within the first thirty minutes is one for the history books. Despite this, it's important to remember that triumphing in sports isn't the sole objective—though the Raiders certainly made a statement that day. #3 Saudi sportswashing wins Despite initial reluctance, the allure of substantial investment proved too irresistible for the sports industry. This year marked a monumental shift as the Saudi Arabian government successfully penetrated the sports sector. Elite soccer talent, with the exception of Messi, demonstrated willingness to compete in sparsely attended Saudi matches for the tantalizing promise of eight-figure salaries. The influence expanded as increasing numbers of sports teams came under Saudi proprietorship. The NBA did not dismiss the possibility of Saudi investment. In a staggering development, LIV Golf—a rival league that sliced through the golf world in 2022—stunned onlookers by declaring an intention to merge with the PGA. This left critics, Tiger Woods included, re-evaluating their opposition. If the thought of Steve Cohen as a contentious owner raises eyebrows, the idea of a Saudi-backed fund purchasing major league baseball or NFL teams takes the debate to new heights. Based on current trends, such a scenario may unfold sooner than anticipated. #4 Rise of women’s sports The longstanding belief that women's sports would thrive with increased visibility and media coverage seems to be more than just a theory—it's a reality. This year’s triumphs in women's sports underscore this point vividly. Take, for instance, the awe-inspiring success of the Women's World Cup, which captivated audiences globally despite the US team's unexpected results. Then there was the record-shattering volleyball game at the University of Nebraska, which drew the largest crowd ever for a women's sporting event. It's clear that superstars such as tennis phenomenon Coco Gauff, gymnast extraordinaire Simone Biles, and basketball powerhouse A'ja Wilson are not just excelling—they're elevating the profile of their respective sports. But perhaps the most electrifying moment this year was the women's basketball Final Four. It featured a showdown between Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese—athletes who are rewriting the narrative for women’s basketball. Although I had to watch it through VPN free Chrome, I don't regret anything. Their face-off attracted legions of new fans, proving that when it comes to thrilling sports moments, those featuring women athletes are not to be underestimated. The evidence is clear: people are eager to watch women's sports; they've always been ready. #5 Head coach gets the halftime zoomies In a notable Week 2 performance, running back Raheem Mostert delivered an impressive stat line of 18 carries for 121 yards and two touchdowns against the New England Patriots. However, despite Mostert's exceptional performance on the field, the media focus shifted away from the player's achievements. The spotlight was instead captured by Head Coach Mike McDaniel's unique reaction post halftime interview, where he was seen making a swift exit from the camera's gaze. McDaniel has been the subject of various internet memes throughout the season, and this particular incident was no exception, garnering significant attention in the lead-up to Halloween. Conclusion Naturally, the purpose of the article was not to retell everything related to the last sports season. These are simply the memes and notable events that come to mind when we talk about the 2023-2024 season. You can add to the list."
Top 6 most likely candidates to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool — named & assessed,https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-27-top-6-most-likely-candidates-to-succeed-jurgen-klopp-at-liverpool-named-assessed/,Michael Ellis,Tribuna.com,2024-01-27T19:27:00.000Z,"After delivering the shocking news that Jurgen Klopp will be resigning as manager this summer, Liverpool have got their succession plans underway.It's been reported that the club has not contacted any coaches to fill in the big shoes yet, but there is already a presumptive frontrunner for the job, along with other more distant possibilities.Here, we're looking at some of the most likely candidates to replace Jurgen Klopp in charge of Liverpool — starting with the most obvious one.Xabi AlonsoThe man leading Bayer Leverkusen's miraculous attempt to end Bayern Munich's domestic dominance also happens to be a fan favourite at Anfield. It surely feels like the stars are aligning.Xabi Alonso is still a beginner as a head coach at a professional level. He favours positional football which should work well for the current crop of players at Liverpool. His preferred formation at Bayer, however, is three at the back, which means some adjustments would need to be made.How Liverpool can line up with Xabi Alonso as Liverpool head coach: 2 optionsAnother concern is his squad management. At Bayer, Alonso has a strongly preferred starting lineup and rotates it reluctantly. It may have to do with a less intense calendar or poor bench options, but this is something he'll have to change if he returns to Liverpool.According to our bookmaker partners MEGAPARI, he is still the likeliest candidate to replace Klopp — and Bayer won't stop him from leaving if he wants it.Roberto De ZerbiThe Brighton boss is also very much in the frame for the job, as confirmed by The Times' Paul Joyce.In many respects, De Zerbi is similar to Alonso: he also wants his team to play with the ball at their feet. However, he has more experience, having successfully worked with Sassuolo in Italy and Shakhtar in Ukraine before coming over to Brighton.He has shown impressive tactical flexibility, setting up his team with three or four players at the back. The defensive structure may have been Brighton's weakest link under De Zerbi, but he never had a player like Virgil van Dijk there.Negotiating with Brighton is usually hard — but Liverpool have a recent positive experience that got them Alexis Mac Allister for a bargain fee.Julian NagelsmannThe German FA still dreams of Jurgen Klopp and will most likely try to talk him out of taking a year out. If they succeed, Julian Nagelsmann will officially be available after only signing a short-term deal last year.Aged 36, Nagelsmann is the youngest among the potential candidates — but he might also be the most experienced. He took Hoffenheim to the Champions League, led RB Leipzig to new heights and won the Bundesliga with Bayern. The circumstances of his sacking from the last club should have no negative impact on his prospects elsewhere — although his reported lack of engagement with players could be concerning.Pep LijndersLiverpool have already announced that Klopp's assistant manager is set to leave in the summer as well as he plans to start his own managerial career. Still, plans can change, especially since no other potential candidate knows this team as well as Lijnders does.The Dutchman is liked by the players and has had a big say on the team's tactical set-up in the last few years, so the transition would be smooth.The biggest question mark is over his ability to be the main man in the room. He already had a go at managing with NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch second tier in 2018. He was sacked after four months and returned to Liverpool. How much has he grown since then?Steven GerrardA couple of years ago, Gerrard seemed to be on track to be the next Liverpool manager. After a miracle win with Rangers in the Scottish Premiership, he started well with Aston Villa where he was contracted until the same summer when Klopp's agreement was supposed to run out.The wheels came off in less than a year. Gerrard was sacked from Villa in October 2022 and could only get a job in Saud Arabia a year later. He has already signed a new contract with Al Ettifaq despite them being in mid-table.As a result, our bookmaker partners MEGAPARI only give it odds of 12 happening. In fairness, Stevie's chances are probably even lower.Ange PostecoglouDespite being already 58 years old, Postecoglou is a new name in the Premier League, but in just half a year, he has reinvigorated Tottenham with a brave tactical approach.Spurs play in a 4-3-3 formation with an extremely high defensive line which is very familiar to Liverpool fans. Unlike the Reds, though, they have both full-backs inverting in possession which is even riskier than what Klopp has done with Trent Alexander-Arnold. Perhaps just as important, Postecoglou has been vocal about supporting Liverpool as a kid, so a chance to take over at Anfield would surely be enticing for him.Unfortunately, Tottenham are highly unlikely to allow their manager to join another 'big six' club, especially since he has just started building a team in North London.Who do you want to see in charge of Liverpool next season?

Thankfully, for Andre Onana, Kobbie Mainoo immediately added another one to make it 4-3 for Man United. Onana, who had some nervy moments in the game, simply stood rooted to his spot as Pedro Neto got into a good position before shooting it in. Arguably, Wolves fought hard to get the win - and even pushed for a draw. Thankfully, Man United outfield players refused to take no for an answer and kept pushing for more goals. As for Onana, questions will be once again asked as to how he made the starting XI over Altay Bayindir. Lisandro Martinez makes fantastic block to save Andre Onana from another howler"

Anthony Martial's agent: 'He will not leave Man United this month',https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-21-anthony-martials-agent-he-will-not-leave-man-united-this-month/,Meghna @ 1819,MEN,2024-01-21T17:09:31.000Z,"Anthony Martial's agent Philippe Lamboley has ruled out an exit from Manchester United for his client this January. Quoted by the MEN, Martial's agent said: ""Anthony will not leave and will stay until his contract ends in June."" Martial currently requires surgery after a hip injury. Given his struggles with injuries in the past, one could presume he won't recover in time to play before his contract runs out. That essentially means he will continue to earn his wages as he undergoes treatment. The duration of his recovery is unknown, meaning it's likely he will leave as a free agent with no more performances for Man United. Martial, 28, has started merely five Premier League games this season. He's spent most of his time either injured, ill, or lacking form. With just two goals to his name this season, Martial's departure as a free agent looks certain. It's just a shame that Man United simply wasted the £36 million they spent on making him the most expensive teenage signing in 2015.

Ryan Giggs is the current holder of the player with the most assists in PL, with 162 assists.That would mean Trent needs 105 more assists to his name in Premier League games to break that record. To become the Liverpool player with the most PL assists, he needs 35 more assists to surpass Steven Gerrard (92 assists).Alexander-Arnold is still only 25, which is quite young for a defender. Moreover, he has the qualities to play further up the field in the future and get more assists.Trent will need to maintain incredible consistency for the next decade or so to surpass Giggs’ feat and make the all-time PL assist record his own.'Same area': Klopp provides injury update on TrentTrent Alexander-Arnold sets Premier League record with assist for Diogo Jota's goal"

It's becoming clearer that Carlo Ancelotti doesn't want to rely on the veteran midfielder even with injuries hitting the squad. Modric has only played 34 minutes in Real Madrid's last three games in all competitions — vs Atleti (14 minutes), vs Girona (20 minutes) and Leipzig (0 minutes). The Croatian icon started and finished Real Madrid's 2-0 win at Getafe but he remains the fourth least-utilized outfield player at Real Madrid this season. Modric has featured in 27 games for Real Madrid this season but has only started 15 of those and has been completely left on the bench six times. The 38-year-old said before the start of the season that he's prepared to play three games a week, but that doesn't seem to be the case now, not necessarily by any fault of his. Judging by the way it's going, Modric may well be on his way out of Real Madrid in the summer. Carlo Ancelotti names one thing he will never ask Luka Modric for – unlike Arda Guler"

'I thought my wife would forgive me': Dani Alves cries while testifying for alleged rape case,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-08-i-thought-my-wife-would-forgive-me-dani-alves-cries-while-testifying-for-alleged-rape-cas/,Kosta König,Mundo Deportivo via Barca Universal,2024-02-08T07:58:00.000Z,"Dani Alves has testified during his trial as he awaits the judge verdict on his alleged rape case.Here is his version of truth, as per Mundo Deportivo.""On the 30th [of December 2022] I met my friends for lunch at the Taberna del Clinic. We arrived around 14:30 in the afternoon. It had been a long time since we had seen each other and the meal went on for a long time. We drank five bottles of wine and a bottle of whisky. These are the ones that appear on the restaurant's ticket. More or less, I drank one and a half bottles of wine and several glasses of whisky.""When we left the restaurant, we went to Nuba [restaurant] and had a round of gin and tonic. To get there, we went by car. Bruno [friend] was driving because I had drinked a lot and couldn't drive.""After the Nuba, we went to the Sutton club with Bruno. We arrived at around 2:30 in the morning... I was escorted to table six. There is only one bathroom next to table six. I'm a frequent visitor of Sutton's and whenever that table is available I don't have to cross the club to go there... The door was open. We got to the booth and we started drinking and dancing with Bruno for a while.""First, two girls came and danced there for a while. Then they invited three more girls, the complainant, and her friends. They were not uncomfortable at all. They arrived, they started to greet us. A conversation started, we were moving around, talking to each other. I am a very close person, but with respect. I think they knew who I was.""We were dancing, interacting. We were already closer, she [the alleged victim] started dancing closer to me, rubbing her private parts against mine... It was a typical disco dance, a little bit of a 'perreo'. A dance a bit closer... She put her hand back and started touching my private parts.""After dancing together, I didn't insist on her going to the bathroom. She said yes immediately. I told her that I was going to the bathroom first and I waited for a while, thinking that she wasn't going to come, that she didn't want to. And when I opened the door to leave the bathroom, I practically saw her at the door.""She got down on her knees in front of me and started giving me a blowj*b. I pulled down my trousers and sat on the toilet bowl. The blowj*b was practically the whole thing. Afterwards, she sat in front of my legs, and I ejaculated out of her body.""I didn't slap her, I didn't throw her on the floor. I am not a violent man. She didn't tell me she didn't want to have sex. At no time did she tell me she didn't want to or anything.""I never saw the complainant and her friends again after that night. When we left the club, I was too drunk. My wife was asleep in bed. It's the same as I stated in the second one [testimony]. In the first one, I didn't tell everything because I thought my wife could forgive me,"" the Brazilian said before starting to cry.Dani Alves' wife confirms divorce in emotional handwritten letter""Then I got the news that they were accusing me of rape, I found it out in the media. The world came crashing down on me. I was practically ruined because they had blocked my back account in Brazil and they had broken all my contracts,"" the 40-year-old added.Here is how the prosecutor responded.""The victim explained to us that she voluntarily entered that place, even though she did not know it was a bathroom. She felt guilty for having entered that place. It is a common feeling in victims, as the forensic experts have said, when they do not deserve any guilt.""""We had a lot of gaps and it's completely normal coming from a victim... Dani Alves grabbed her and brought her mouth close to his d*ck. She explains that he penetrated her from behind and ejaculated in and out her body. She was very brave, she has been throughout the proceedings.""Dani Alves slapped her in the face when she was on the floor. Alves said 'Say you're my little b**ch'. She explains that he experienced a terrifying situation. Her story has been persistent, credible and harsh. It has been a complicated situation for the victim.""Dani Alves was placed in custody without bail until his trial is resolved. The Brazilian suspiciously changed testimony in court five times.

Chelsea vs. Aston Villa: FA Cup Fourth Round Preview,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-22-chelsea-vs-aston-villa-fa-cup-fourth-round-preview/,Alex,,2024-01-22T18:22:55.000Z,"On Friday night, in the fourth round of the FA Cup, Chelsea will host fellow EPL battlers Aston Villa to succeed in cup glory despite a rapid turnaround. The 71st-minute goal scored by Ollie Watkins in a domestic match last year at Stamford Bridge separated the two teams; consequently, Unai Emery's squad enters this match with a psychological edge. Chelsea vs. Aston Villa: Form Guide  Chelsea's season has been distinctly disappointing; however, the capital club secured a 1-0 victory over Fulham in their most recent match, thanks to Palmer's first-half penalty, which elevated the capital club to ninth place in the Premier League standings. In fact, they are only one point behind seventh-place Manchester United in the Premier League. Furthermore, in all competitions, they have won four of their last five games, including Preston North End 4-0 in the third round of the FA Cup. The Blues have won the FA Cup on eight separate occasions; however, they have only triumphed over a lower-tier Preston squad thus far and are already up against a top-tier EPL side in the fourth round. As a result, many are predicting an early exit for the London unit. Chelsea: Previous 6 Matches  A scoreless cup tie appeared probable when Aston Villa travelled to Middlesbrough in the previous round, a Championship-level opponent who challenged Unai Emery's side until a catastrophic error in the final seconds put an end to them. The Lions had exerted considerable effort for an unsuccessful 87 minutes. However, as Middlesbrough approached the threshold of forcing a rematch, a speculative goal by Matty Cash entered the bottom corner after a deft deflection off Emmanuel Latte Lath. This advanced Villa to round four, where Chelsea awaits this Friday. With Wembley supremacy in the balance under the direction of knockout specialist Emery, Villa Park supporters can certainly aspire to that moment. This week's visitors to the capital arrive in joint-second position in the Premier League standings, 43 points level with Man City and Arsenal and five points behind leaders Liverpool.  With the 1-0 victory at the Riverside, they advanced to this round of the FA Cup with a record of nine victories, three draws, and one loss in their previous thirteen competitive contests. Subsequently, they drew a domestic encounter with Everton. Nevertheless, in the league, the Villans have accumulated six victories in their last ten matches, triumphing over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Spurs in the process. Aston Villa: Previous 6 Matches  Chelsea vs. Aston Villa: Head-to-Head   Chelsea vs. Aston Villa: The Betting Odds   Chelsea 11/10  Aston Villa 5/2  Draw 11/4  Unsurprisingly, Chelsea are odds on to beat Villa from favoured football betting sites due to their recent turnaround in form. However, their most recent cup tie (Carabao Cup) with Middlesbrough resulted in a 0-1 loss. They’ve also been untrustworthy for most of the season, and Villa is in an early fight for the Premier League title, thus proving Friday’s visitors to be a formidable challenge.  Chelsea vs. Aston Villa Injury Updates  Chelsea have struggled significantly with injuries this season, and the Blues will be without several first-team players for the FA Cup once more. Lesley Ugochukwu, Marc Cucurella, Romeo Lavia, Wesley Fofana, Reece James, Christopher Nkunku, and Robert Sanchez are all sidelined with injuries at the Africa Cup of Nations, whereas Nicolas Jackson is representing Senegal. Ben Chilwell returned from a protracted hamstring injury to start last week's match against Fulham; however, Pochettino will want to exercise caution regarding his fitness. For Villa, Bertrand Traore is the only player who has been called up to the AFCON; alongside Lucas Digne, long-term knee injuries Emiliano Buendia and Tyrone Mings are also out of contention. According to Emery, Pau Torres (ankle) and Youri Tielemans (calf) have participated in team training in recent weeks and are expected to be available. Ollie Watkins, Douglas Luiz, and Moussa Diaby are among the players Emery will likely recall to the first XI on Friday. Chelsea vs. Aston Villa: Prediction   Stamford Bridge has been the site of two consecutive league victories for Villa, one of which was a 0-1 loss earlier this season. Although a clean sheet is not anticipated this time around, an away victory seems probable, given Villa's outstanding form this season. Seven of their most recent eight matches across all competitions have seen Unai Emery's squad go unbeaten, with at least one goal scored in each of those encounters. Since September, however, they have failed to maintain a clean sheet away from home, and Chelsea are regaining form after accumulating eleven goals in their last six matches. I won’t be surprised to see Villa clinch a 2-1 away win, especially with Chelsea’s packed schedule this week.

Klopp answers,https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-02-05-did-fatigue-play-a-role-in-liverpools-underwhelming-performance-vs-arsenal-klopp-answers/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Liverpoolfc.com,2024-02-05T17:00:00.000Z,"When asked if he feels that a case of fatigue could’ve played a factor in Liverpool’s lethargic performance against Arsenal, Jurgen Klopp replied: “I understand 100 per cent where you are coming from and stuff like this. I have to make a line-up. Would I make the same line-up again? Yes. That's actually the only thing how I can judge it. After seeing the game, maybe not.“Without seeing the game, I would do it the same. Dom [Szoboszlai] couldn't start, he is out injured actually, so we had to make another change as well and these kind of things.“That's all normal. It's not about that. With these boys, we can play much better football. That's actually the one thing we take – we want to and have to play better football and we will.  For today, again it's a kind of a strange one because, yes, they started well, but that's what you should expect.“Home game, Arsenal, we beat them here a few weeks ago in the FA Cup… actually the first half in the FA Cup was a similar first half, they had more chances in that game than today but then we didn't concede and that's obviously a big difference.“Could we have defended better? Yes, definitely, 100 per cent, but that's how it is and they probably deserved the goal with the game they played, but we stayed in the game and 1-0 is really not a result where you should think white flag and go home. We got a present for our first goal, we forced it, but then, as I said, the story of the second half, we will never know how it would have been if we don't concede the goal.“Our two main guns, a misunderstanding, that just shows they are human beings. That actually makes the thing they usually do even more special because sometimes you forget they are humans as well. For today, the boys are not happy, we are not happy, 100 per cent – but that's it now, we don't have to make more of a game. ""If you play an away game at Arsenal, you can play super here and lose. I would have loved to have seen that, but it's possible. That's why we take it, deal with it and go from here.”Liverpool just had a bad day against Arsenal and did  not have luck on their side either.

WhatsApp messages, emails and voice recordings exchanged between Eto'o and a former Fecafoot executive have been provided as evidence accusing the ex-footballer of abuse of power, match-fixing, threats and inciting violence. The evidence has already been sent to FIFA’s Ethics Committee in a comprehensive petition as far back as July 2023 by former vice-president Fecafoot Henry Njalla Quan Junior and some other members of the Cameroon FA. The matter is also being investigated by CAF, Africa's football governing body. Njalla Quan Junior claims Eto'o fixed a match between his team Njalla Quan Sports Academy and Kumba City FC. Eto'o allegedly made a phone call to the referees at halftime during the game after which two dubious penalties were awarded and five red cards were shown to the opposition team. After the evidence was sent to FIFA, an associate of Eto'o reportedly texted Quan Junior with a threatening message. The message reads, “I am a mafia of this revolution and in this specific mafia we do not betray our leaders. I have protected the interest of our mission till date. However, if you f**k with me be ready to carry the load of the circumstances.”A 19-page letter sent to FIFA also accuses Eto'o of corruption since he became president of Cameroon's football association. The letter signed by nine members of Fecafoot also accuses FIFA of not treating the matter quickly enough. They cited the case of Spanish FA boss Luis Rubiales who was handed a 90-day suspension within weeks of being accused of sexual harassment for kissing Barca icon Jenni Hermoso on the lips at the Women's World Cup final in September. Eto'o and his lawyers are yet to respond to the hefty accusations amid overwhelming evidence but the investigation remains ongoing.

On Friday, he informed Erik ten Hag that he was ill but reportedly left out the fact that he went out on Thursday night. To do something like that one night before a crucial game is not something Ten Hag will take lightly. This led to a massive outrage among fans, especially since he was rewarded with a bigger contract that included weekly wages of £300,000. Despite that, his performances have been below-average this season, with just four goals to his name.  However, a subsection of fans believe Rashford has had it very tough lately.

Players like Antony (€95 million), Harry Maguire (€93m), Jadon Sancho (€85m) and Casemiro (€82m) are a huge contributing factor behind that inflated figure. Interestingly, it doesn't include Rasmus Hojlund (£72m), Mason Mount (£55m) or Andre Onana (£47m) - all of whom were signed the following summer.

If Arsenal are willing to pay big for his wages, estimated to be an eye-watering €6 million per month, they could pull off one of the biggest transfer coups ever. Of course, the Gunners won't match what he's earning at PSG, meaning the world-class attacker may have to lower his demands. Mbappe's goalscoring numbers have not dipped since he joined PSG in 2017, hitting at least 15 goals in each of his seasons in Paris. In 2023/24, he's already scored 20 goals and assisted four more in the French league. Although he's never played in the Premier League, Mbappe, only 25, could potentially thrive.

2 ways Chelsea could line up under Jose Mourinho,https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-16-no-more-colwill-at-leftback-two-ways-chelsea-could-line-up-under-mourinho/,Aleksei Blokhin,Tribuna,2024-01-16T12:23:58.000Z,"Jose Mourinho has been sacked by Roma earlier today.Mauricio Pochettino's job is reportedly safe but there is no such word as 'safe' at Chelsea — things may change in the blink of an eye. So a third coming of The Special One remains possible until he gets a new job.We've decided to imagine how Chelsea would look like under the Portuguese with their current squad.We've included Nkunku in the XIs as the severity of his injury remains unknown but omitted long-term absences such as James and Fofana.Option 1: 4-2-3-1Almost everyone uses this formation these days, including Poch. But guess who made it popular in England? You’re right — Jose Mourinho in his first Chelsea spell!This will likely see Caicedo dropped to the bench. Enzo adds much-needed creativity while Gallagher is ‘the only player who would have survived in Jose’s first Chelsea team’ — he could be Mourinho’s modern-day John Obi Mikel.Jose would also put an end to Poch's experiment of playing Colwill at left-back; Levi would compete with Badiashile for the starting spot at left centre-back.Up front, Mourinho needs a classic target man and the closest to this profile is Broja (sidenote: prepare for a Lukaku return next season). The question is who'll play on the wings but we'll go with the conservative option of Sterling and Nkunku, although if Mudryk is as hard-working as he likes to show off on Instagram he might get a nod.Option 2: 3-5-2Mourinho is not the biggest fan of this formation but at Roma, he's shown that he can adapt his ideas to the players available and it meant using the three-at-the-back shape.Chelsea have a lot of centre-backs and excellent wing-backs, so returning to the Tuchel-era 3-5-2 could be possible if Jose is back at the Bridge.We see Mourinho picking Caicedo over Enzo for this one to add solidity to the midfield, with Nkunku and Broja up front — and Jackson and Sterling getting benched.Note that Chalobah will return to the squad. Mourinho reportedly wanted him at Roma and he's an excellent player for a back-three."

Modric has now been left on the bench in Real Madrid's last two La Liga games. The iconic midfielder last played for Los Blancos in our 4-2 Copa Del Rey defeat to Atletico Madrid. He was on for 66 minutes. The 38-year-old has played 24 matches for Madrid this season registering six assists and scoring one goal.

What was Andre Onana like at Inter Milan?

Was Onana any good for Inter to begin with? Was he worth the £40 million fee? Our Serie A expert Luigi Giusa explains.On Onana's level""In my opinion, Onana at Inter overperformed the whole season compared to his actual standards. However, Inter had a very good defensive phase, this resulted in a low amount of great chances for the opponents.""Basically he had to 'save' less shots per game. Anyway, he proved to have some weaknesses too at Inter, for example coming off his line during corners and indirect free kicks. Look at the league stats from last season. Handanovic: 14 games, 18 goals conceded. Onana: 24 games, 24 goals conceded.""On the transfer fee""Considering the transfer fees for Kepa, Raya or Ramsdale, I'd say Man United have overpaid. The last two went for about £30 million less or more in the recent years. Onana had the best season of his entire life.""It's normal that he was a bit overpriced bun honest price for him would have been around £35–40 million but Man United often pay more for the players. Look at Sancho, Antony, Amrabat... really poor management.""Onana for Inter last season — you can judge for yourselfAndre Onana shows true colours after being dropped from Cameroon's starting line-up"

Barca have reportedly been monitoring Greenwood since the start of the season and are said to be highly impressed with what they've seen so far. Meanwhile, Greenwood has told friends a transfer to Barcelona would be a 'dream move' if it were to ever happen. “Barcelona want to sign Greenwood, and he wants to move there. The next step is for the clubs to come to an agreement,"" a source told The Sun. Meanwhile, Manchester United are also willing to sell Greenwood at the end of the season following the rape scandal that forced him to miss 18 months of action due to suspension and an investigation. However, Greenwood was cleared when the 'victim' dropped all charges against the winger in February last year. It took another six months for Greenwood to find a club with La Liga outfit Getafe taking a bet on him. The 22-year-old has lit up the stage in Spain racking up five goals and four assists in 19 games and becoming a key player at Getafe. Greenwood is currently valued at €7.5m on Transfermarkt but he'll cost a lot more if he keeps performing well until the end of the season.

Two No 6s left our club [Henderson and Fabinho]. The market heated up. We thought we could maybe do Caicedo. We’d already done Mac Allister before. So we went in, he had an emotional agreement already with Chelsea and Pochettino. Then Lavia had his own reasons.

Everything in the ‘if not’ scenario worked out.”Earlier this season, Klopp joked that he was 'lucky' that neither Caicedo nor Lavia joined Liverpool, as the Reds ended up signing Wataru Endo. The Japanese has proven to be a revelation at Anfield.“It was this night, I come in the stadium, the kids are playing and crowd is cheering - I forgot for 10 or 15 minutes I am a public person.

The round-of-16 first games will be played on 13/14 and 20/21 February. There's no lack of quality here. The reigning champions Manchester City will be looking to secure back-to-back triumphs. Regular favourites Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are hungry to add another European Cup to their cabinets. Arsenal would want to prove they are back in business while Borussia Dortmund are eager to show that their topping the Group of Death was no fluke.In case you somehow missed the draw, here is the list of all last-16 match-ups:Who is more likely to cruise to the next round and who risks being eliminated early? Let's take a look at our Champions League Last 16 Power Rankings and the betting odds for the first leg ties!1. Manchester City The Citizens have always been tipped as Champions League favourites but this time Lady Luck is really smiling at them: Pep Guardiola's side have been drawn against arguably the weakest last-16 team, Copenhagen. Fans see a win as a must and even a draw will be considered a massive disappointment.Odds: 1.33 (Bet365)CLICK HERE TO BET ON MAN CITY VS COPENHAGEN WITH A BONUS!2. Bayern MunichThe Bundesliga giants are surprisingly not the first in the league table but they are firmly in the race, trailing leaders Bayer Leverkusen by just two points. Thomas Tuchel's side were shockingly eliminated from the German Cup by Saarbrucken but they can still win the double.Bayern's new striker, Harry Kane is on fire with 27 goals and eight assists in 26 games across all competitions. The Englishman is thirsty for trophies after ten years at Tottenham.Odds: 1.57 (Bet365)3. Paris Saint-GermainPSG finished second in the Group of Death that also featured Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan and Newcastle. Traditionally, the Parisians are dominating Ligue 1 and perform relatively poorly in the Champions League. However, the fact that they were drawn against minnows Real Sociedad makes them the favourites for the Round of 16 and boosts their position in the rankings.Odds: 1.7 (Betway)4. Arsenal It's been a while since the Gunners made noise in Europe. The last time Arsenal featured in the Champions League was in the 2016-17 season. There is still hope for Mikel Arteta's side in the Premier League where they sit third behind Man City (2nd) and Liverpool (1st) but the league leaders look ridiculously strong and Man City have a game in hand.Perhaps, focusing on the Champions League is worth considering.Odds: 1.87 (William Hill)5. Inter MilanInter Milan were the runners-up in the Champions League last season. This time, they are facing Atletico Madrid in the Round of 16, and that means Inter's former star Diego Simeone will return to San Siro.The Nerazzurri look confident in defence having replaced Andre Onana with Yann Sommer, and their attackers Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram have scored a combined 32 goals this season. And they are hungry for more. Odds: 2.0 (BWin)6. Real Madrid Real Madrid may have ups and downs but going to the Round of 8 is something their fans see as a must but this time it might be a tougher task.With long-term injuries to Eder Militao and Thibaut Courtois, Madrid's defence is now more vulnerable and RB Leipzig could capitalise on that. However, with Vinicius, Rodrygo, Joselu and Jude Bellingham up front, Los Blancos are still firm favourites to qualify for the next stage.Odds: 2.2 (BWin)7. PSV EindhovenOn Matchday 1, PSV were thrashed 0-4 by Arsenal. After three games, they had two points in the bag and almost zero hope. However, they bounced back and ended the group stage as runners-up to Arsenal.In the Eredivisie, PSV are head and shoulders above everyone else - 12 points separate them from second-placed Feyenoord. That means head coach Peter Bosz can rest some of his key players in the league games and come out all guns blazing against Dortmund.Odds: 2.25 (Stake)8. BarcelonaThe team is unbalanced and losing 3-5 on home soil, the head coach has announced his exit... For Barcelona opponents, it's arguably the best time to play against the Catalans.Robert Lewandowski's dip in form and Gavi's injury add to the long list of Barca's problems and it's really hard to predict how their two-leg clash with Napoli would pan out.Odds: 2.6 (N1Bet)CLICK HERE TO BET ON BARCELONA VS NAPOLI WITH A BONUS!9. Napoli Napoli's home form this season has been nothing short of atrocious, and their 9th place in the Serie A table isn't the worst possible result, to be honest. The Parthenopei sacked head coach Luciano Spalletti who won them the domestic league and shockingly replaced him with Rudi Garcia who now is also gone. With Walter Mazzarri in the dugout, Napoli's spirits seem to have lifted a bit but would that be enough to qualify against struggling Barcelona?Odds: 2.85 (Ivibet)10. Borussia DortmundEveryone was writing Dortmund off but they sensationally topped their group. Considering BVB lost their biggest star, Jude Bellingham, in the summer, it is even more surprising.While Edin Terzic seems to have coped with the Englishman's exit, the only problem that can really spoil Dortmund's party is lack of depth in the squad.Odds: 3.2 (SkyBet)11. RB LeipzigRB Leipzig proved they can do wonders when they were leading 2-0 against Man City in the group. Pep Guardiola's side gave them a reality check in the second half but no one should underestimate the German outfit.Real Madrid will be wary of that but the likes of Xavi Simons, Dani Olmo and Benjamin Sesko (and of course, head coach Marco Rose) will be up for the challenge.Odds: 3.25 (Betclic)12. Atletico MadridCan Diego Simeone finally win the Champions League? Atleti's display in the group against Feyenoord, Lazio and Celtic suggests so. The Rojiblancos were undefeated at the group stage.

Recalling one La Liga episode amid Roque's red card in Alaves – Madrid player escaped without a yellow back then,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-04-barca-fans-recall-episode-with-madrid-amid-roques-red-card-in-alaves-their-player-escaped/,Nаdine,Tribuna.com,2024-02-04T08:43:00.000Z,"Barcelona fans are up in arms following Vitor Roque's second yellow card in the Alaves game. The Brazilian striker was sent off for what appeared to be minimal contact but VAR didn't even review the decision due to its policy on yellow-card fouls.Roque's foul is somewhat similar to the one Jude Bellingham committed on Ivan Rakitic in October '23. Back then, the Englishman tackled the opponent, and did it in a much rougher way than Vitor.But guess what? He escaped any punishment and wasn't even shown a yellow..Luckily for the Catalans, they were able to maintain the winning score even while outnumbered and secured all three points away from home.Naturally, Barca will appeal the referees' decision so that the 18-year-old is able to feature in the Granada encounter next week.Why VAR didn't check Vitor Roque's red card v Alaves explained"

He coached Ecuador and Maccabi Tel Aviv before that. Barcelona are yet to begin their managerial search with Deco claiming Xavi's resignation took the club by surprise.

Barcelona have been putting pressure on the player to sign that extension and spread his salary but De Jong's entourage have been reluctant to negotiate. It opens the door for De Jong to leave in the summer. A source told Esport3 that De Jong is now open to furthering his career away from Barcelona, with the club seriously considering taking him off their wage bill if they get a good offer at the end of the season. De Jong joined Barcelona in 2019 under the presidency of Josep Maria Bartomeu. The talented midfielder was placed on high wages commiserate with Barca players at the time.

Chelsea’s Bold Move Away From a Crypto Casino Sponsorship Opportunity,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-30-chelseas-bold-move-away-from-a-crypto-casino-sponsorship-opportunity/,Alex,,2024-01-30T04:18:44.000Z,"It was a headline that caught the eye of both sports aficionados and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike: Chelsea, one of the giants of English football, had been inching towards a deal with a prominent crypto casino. And then, in a surprising pivot, the club decided to call the whole thing off. This decision came amidst a climate where the intertwined worlds of sport and digital currency are both fraught with fervent debates and rocketing interest. What initially sparked Chelsea's interest in a crypto casino deal?Chelsea Football Club, one of England's top soccer teams, has decided against a deal with online gambling company Stake for a new front-of-shirt sponsorship, as reported by The Telegraph.Previously, it was widely reported in the UK media that Chelsea was nearing an agreement with Stake for a one-year sponsorship deal. This deal was expected to be on par financially with Chelsea's former agreement with the company Three, reportedly around £40 million (approximately $50.8 million) annually.Nevertheless, Chelsea has chosen to end these discussions and is currently exploring other potential partnerships.Why the change in direction?This change in direction follows criticism from Chelsea supporters regarding the Stake sponsorship. A survey by the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) revealed that 77% of participants were opposed to the Stake deal. The CST criticized the deal, saying it would undermine the efforts of the Chelsea Foundation in conducting workshops on gambling harm awareness in schools in West London.The CST acknowledged Chelsea's need to increase its revenue but stressed that it should not compromise the club's values.For Stake, this partnership would have been their second major shirt sponsorship in the Premier League, following a deal with Everton for the 2022/23 season, believed to be worth around £10 million ($12.7 million) annually.Chelsea's decision to halt the Stake deal has not been officially explained, but it is a move that will likely please both the club's fans and anti-gambling campaigners.The search for a new sponsorThe club, now searching for a new shirt sponsor, has faced several challenges in this pursuit. Proposals from Allianz and Paramount were reportedly turned down, the latter due to the Premier League's concerns about disturbing relationships with TV partners.As Chelsea, under the majority ownership of Clearlake Capital, aims to double its revenue, securing a sponsorship deal comparable to or exceeding the previous The Three contract is crucial, especially considering the club's £600 million ($763 million) investment in players last season and the need to adhere to financial fair play (FFP) regulations.Contrary to some rumors, Oman Air will not be Chelsea's main sponsor for the 2023/24 season, despite recent speculation fueled by images of a company representative with Chelsea's new head coach Mauricio Pochettino.The resistance to the Stake deal is part of a wider backlash against betting sponsorships in the Premier League. For instance, Aston Villa's recent agreement with BK8 was criticized by fans, though the club did not end the partnership.This trend comes as Premier League clubs have agreed to phase out betting sponsorships on the front of matchday shirts by the end of the 2025/26 season.Conclusion: The bold decision of Chelsea as a signpostChelsea's choice to not proceed with a crypto casino sponsorship speaks volumes in an era where every move a club makes is under the microscope. The decision has ripple effects, not just across football but in the realms of online gambling and digital currency, too. It's a reminder that in the fast-paced world of sports and even faster-moving sector of cryptocurrency, sometimes the best play is the one that's not made. As the landscapes evolve, only time will tell if such collaborations will become the norm or remain an 'almost happened' footnote in the grand narrative of sports sponsorships."
3 positives from Barca's disappointing 3-3 draw v Granada,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-12-3-positives-from-barcas-disappointing-33-draw-v-granada/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-02-12T11:40:00.000Z,"Barcelona were disappointing again on Sunday as they lost precious points in the title following a 3-3 draw to Granada at home. Granada played well on the night but Barca were architects of their own downfall as horrendous defending had Xavi punching his seat in fury. However, there are many positives Barca can take from such a game. Let's focus on three. Lamine Yamal is HIMThere's hardly any more debate. Lamine Yamal is everything Barca have been seeking since the departure of Lionel Messi — a talented young forward bursting through La Masia with the physicality and confidence to take the game by the scruff of the neck and make things happen. Yamal was named Man of the Match in this game and it's easy to say Barca could've lost if the 16-year-old didn't show up with two goals. Barca fans can look at Lamine and dream about the future of their club. That was indeed a stunning performance from a player who has been incredible all season. It's now five goals and as many assists for Lamine this season. Raise your hand if you know another 16-year-old doing the same in Europe. Bring it down. They're mostly still in school.Barca have a new no. 6Xavi has unearthed a weapon that could help Barca until the end of the season by using Andreas Christensen as number 6. The Danish centre-back was brilliant again in his makeshift position.Christensen allowed Gundogan and De Jong to express themselves in midfieldChristensen only lost possession twice in the 67 minutes he spent on the pitch. He was never dribbled past and completed 35 of 36 passes – a staggering 97% pass accuracy. That Xavi levels when he was playing. One could hardly tell if Christensen was a seasoned midfielder or a defender playing the role for only the second time in his Barca career. Lewandowski's brilliant 2024 continuesA striker has done at least 80% of his job when he scores a goal during the game. That's what Lewandowski has been doing more frequently in 2024 and Granada was no different. Although the Polish striker missed one big chance in the game, he didn't underperform his 1.02 xG (expected goals) as he managed to register his name on the scoresheet. What's more, Lewa has now scored six times for Barca in 2024, including scoring in successive La Liga games. Barca can rest easy with their top striker now contributing goals more regularly for the team."

The Ukrainian was withdrawn during the win over Liverpool with another injury. ""With Alex we don't know,"" Mikel Arteta said in his post-match press conference. ""He had some feeling in his calf again and we had to take him off.""As Arteta suggested, this is not Zinchenko's first calf injury. He missed four months of football in total with a calf problem that he sustained in the final games of last season.The injury also saw him miss the defeats to Fulham and Liverpool around the New Year. He also had the same problem in November 2022, unavailable for 11 games.At Arsenal, altogether Zinchenko has suffered calf injuries four times and missed 19 games in the past. The extent of the recent knock is still unknown. But why does this keep happening? Well, although no medical explanation has been given, it appears that Zinchenko's work rate and all action style are taking a toll on his calves, making them susceptible to muscle tears and strains. The 27-year-old seamlessly switches between left-back and midfield, tirelessly bombing forward in attack and tracking back resolutely in defence.We all hope that Arsenal's medical team can find a way to manage this reoccurring problem.

Gavi is probably recovering quicker from the injury given his young age. The 19-year-old injured his ACL while playing for his country in November.

""The Liverpool game is gone now and we need to focus on West Ham and the next one after that and the next one after that.""If we want to stay in the race, we need to focus on each game and give everything we can in every single game."" The Gunners sit merely two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool ahead of what promises to be a crunch week for sides in the title race. Arsenal take on West Ham United and a win could overtake Manchester City, who are level on points, if they drop points against Everton.

Sociedad do not intend to exercise their option to buy him permanently and have reportedly found a replacement in Real Betis' Juan Miranda. Miranda is available for free this summer and Sociedad believe he'd be better than Tierney. He's appeared 12 times across competitions for the Spanish side so far, missing most games through injury. The defender had earlier stated he 'enjoys' playing for Sociedad. If they refuse to keep him, his options appear limited. Returning to Arsenal would mean playing a bit-part role, which won't be enough for him. The 26-year-old is contracted to the Gunners till 2026 but they may choose to sell him instead.

Moreover, media keep linking the 28-year-old with a return to London. It looks like Gnabry's story is a perfect definition of 'You don't know what you've got till it's gone'.What went wrong for the German international at Arsenal though? Speaking to The Players' Tribune in 2020, Gnabry admitted his attitude was wrong: big money sort of shifted his focus.The first one to notice it was his teammate and compatriot Per Mertesacker.""No matter what I did in training, he would come up to me afterwards and start yelling, like, 'Serge, remember where you come from!!!! You are from Stuttgart!!!! Humility, humility, humility!!!! Serge, you think you’re GOOD now, huh? You must be humble!!!!!! HUMILITY!!!!!'"" Gnabry remembered.""Per knew how fast everything changes. You’re 15 and you’re still asking your parents for allowance money. Then you’re 17 or 18 and you’re making more money than your whole family. Imagine that. You just can’t cope with it.""Then the change in Serge became obvious to his parents.""When I broke into the first team, I started spending my money on so much unnecessary stuff. The £600 toiletry bag. The sparkly Christian Louboutins from back in the day. The Rolex,"" the winger went on.""That’s the one that broke my parents. I literally remember my mum saying, 'Serge, you know … this might not be forever. You can’t be spending money like this. You need to stay grounded because everyone falls down at some point.' It was like my mum saw the future.""Literally, a few weeks after that conversation, I went down. Everything kind of fell apart. I injured my knee, and I couldn’t do anything for about eight months. Time was just frozen. When I finally got back to the pitch, I couldn’t get into the squad.""At first, Gnabry left Arsenal for a loan spell at West Bromwich but it was far from being a successful one: in three games for the senior team and three games for the U21s, the German only provided one assist. He returned to Arsenal in the January 2016 transfer window and then sealed a permanent exit at the end of the season.If you look at Gnabry's time at Arsenal, there's a striking contrast between his numbers for the youth team and the senior squad:Flop or not, Gnabry still has a place for Arsenal in his heart. Last summer, Sky Sports asked him if he watched Arsenal in 2022/23, and the answer was: ""Of course I did. I think there’s this saying, 'Once a Gunner, always a Gunner', so I was rooting for them, hoping for them."""

Liverpool Echo's Joe Thomas wrote that VAR indeed reviewed the incident in real time. Referee Thomas Bramall wasn't asked to check the pitchside monitor because officials believed that Robinson's arm was alongside his body when contact with the ball occurred. Some may argue that the touch was accidental from that specific position, suggesting it shouldn't be a penalty. However, fans were left puzzled by the explanation for the decision.Paddy Power: ""VAR: 'Yes, Antonee Robinson has handballed it on the line but we’ve checked the club badge, and as it would’ve benefitted Everton football club, it’s no penalty. Play on.'""All Everton: ""Can somebody tell me why that’s not a penalty. Robbed, week after week.""Jim Keoghan: ""I think it’s now scientifically impossible for Everton to get a penalty.""

When Real Madrid trained on Wednesday ahead of their game against Girona this weekend, they did so without any fit centre-back. Carlo Ancelotti had to do without Nacho who pulled off after complaining of muscle overload. Antonio Rudiger also missed the session as he's still struggling with the blow he suffered at Getafe. With Real Madrid unable to count on David Alaba and Eder Militao for some considerable period, it leaves the team in limbo going into the business end of the season. For the Girona game, there's a real possibility that Ancelotti will have to set up his team without a natural centre-back in defence. Starting Tchoumeni at centre-back makes sense considering he's played there before. Carvajal is too small to partner with Tchouameni as Real Madrid could get bullied with aerial balls. Also, Camavinga would help Los Blancos more as the defensive midfielder. That leaves Ferland Mendy as the best bet at left-center-back considering how defensively solid he is. Here's what that lineup could look like: Ancelotti warned against repeating failed 'experiment' in Madrid derby"

The legendary arena where the 2026 World Cup will open. And the final - in a gigantic stadium in the USA,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-08-the-legendary-arena-where-the-2026-world-cup-will-open-and-the-final-in-a-gigantic-stadiu/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Tribuna,2024-02-08T11:23:45.000Z,"FIFA has announced where and when the first and last games of the 2026 World Cup will take place.This is quite a reason to admire the arenas in Mexico and the USA.The World Cup kicks off on June 11th at the legendary Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, which has a capacity of more than 83,000 spectators.The World Cup finals were held there twice: in 1970 and 1986. First, the Brazilians won thanks to a goal by Pelé, then the Argentines won when thanks to Maradona's incredible performance.Only two stadiums in the world have hosted two finals, with the Maracana being one of them - but the 2026 World Cup in Mexico will only host the early stages of the competition, with all crucial games taking place in America.An interesting detail: Azteca doesn't look particularly big from the outside because the pitch is nine meters below street level. During construction, care was taken to ensure that the sun shone vertically across the lawn so that the teams always played under the same conditions.The final of the tournament will take place on July 19th at MetLife Stadium in New York. The NFL teams New York Giants and New York Jets play there.The stadium was built in 2010 for $1.6 billion - at the time it was the most expensive in the world. The arena's capacity is 82,566 people.The stadium has an atypical sponsorship history. The German insurance company Allianz wanted to acquire the naming rights during construction - it offered between 20 and 30 million dollars. But this news angered New York's Jewish community because of the Alliance's ties to the leadership of Nazi Germany during World War II. The deal was therefore never completed.In the summer of 2011, another insurance company MetLife purchased the rights. There were no questions here.The choice of MetLife Stadium is now a question mark even within the United States. It's not the newest, not the cosiest - it's probably not just about the arena, but also about the possibility of hosting the World Cup final in New York."

The Red Devils have scored merely four times from set-pieces despite 71 attempted shots so far. Against Aston Villa this Sunday though, Man United scored their first goal via an almost perfect set-piece. Bruno Fernandes' shot from the corner found Harry Maguire, whose headed effort found Rasmus Hojlund. The striker made no mistake in smashing it in. This also makes it Hojlund's fifth goal in his last five games for Man United after struggling to score at the beginning of the season. Usually, Man United fail to pass the ball to the right player who can take the shot. In this case, Maguire not only won the header but also found the right man in Hojlund. Of course, the goal would not have stood if not for Hojlund but Maguire's return to the starting XI has been impressive already.

5 players at Barca whose performances could get Xavi sacked,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-16-5-players-at-barca-whose-performances-could-get-xavi-sacked/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-01-16T13:45:00.000Z,"If Xavi eventually gets sacked at Barca it will be because the players he trusts and puts on the field failed to perform to the expectation. That's exactly what's happening at Barcelona today. There are at least five players at Barca whose performances this season are why Xavi isn't sitting too comfortably in his managerial seat. Let's talk. Ronald AraujoIt's high time we say it, Ronald Araujo is nowhere near the player he was last season. We can take the game against Real Madrid as an example, Araujo looked bizarre as Vini Jr. gave him the run around to score a first-half hat-trick. The big defender gave away a penalty and was clumsy in defending before finally getting himself sent off, despite being captain at the time. Even if we scrap the distasteful Clasico, Araujo has only helped Barca keep 6 clean sheets in his 19 other appearances this season. That should worry Xavi. Jules KoundeIt's looking like playing Kounde at centre-back is a risk Xavi should stop taking. We've watched the Frenchman make error after after error leading to goals against Barca from that position. What should worry Xavi is that teams are beginning to exploit his tardiness and clumsiness. That was the case against Girona, Almeria, Las Palmas and recently against Real Madrid. Kounde's problem might be overconfidence or a sheer lack of it. However, the player does reasonably well when playing at right-back. Maybe Xavi should try him there more often, or even permanently. Alejandro BaldeIf Balde doesn't improve quickly, Barca might have to pull out their checkbook and sign a proven left-back. They need to. This season has seen the unmasking of Balde by Barca's opponents. They now know there's a gap he'll leave behind on the left when he makes his attacking forays and forgets to track back. They simply exploit it to hurt Barca. Balde recently turned 20 which a barely an excuse for his lack of defensive awareness. But in that regard, Xavi and his staff must coach him closely. However, there's no legislating for Balde's lack of output in the final third. Xavi doesn't clip his wings and pays dearly for that sacrifice. Still, the player produces precious little at the other end of the pitch. Just the one assist in 25 games for an attack-minded fullback is not good enough. Not at Barca and certainly not at any top club. Ferran TorresThere's a strong argument that Ferran Torres performs better as an impact sub than as a starter. I support that notion too – but not after watching him start Barca's last three games. If Xavi continues to start Ferran at the expense of better wingers like Joao Felix, the outcome could be disastrous particularly when you watch how much Barca struggles to break down opponents when he starts. In El Clasico, Ferran was spotted fuming at Vinicius, who was taunting the Barca after scoring a hat-trick. One can say it was more from the frustration of watching a player do remarkably well while playing in the same position as him. Barca fans would prefer he channels that anger to perform on the pitch when he plays. Pedri**Pedri is Pedri and I wouldn't have his name here if not for injury. But let's face it. Pedri is not delivering the good Barca desperately needs at the moment. Many in Blaugrana will argue that Pedri has the same talent if not more than Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, but the gap between them statistically is miles apart and we know why. Pedri is not scoring goals or making assists. He scored in the early days of the season and claimed an assist as Barca beat Porto but that's been it in 13 games. That's scarcely good enough for a player who Xavi heavily relies on. Frenkie De Jong recovered from injury and has been putting up Man of the Match performances since. 33-year-old Ilkay Gundogan has 10 goal involvements already, seven of which are assists. It tells you Pedri needs to step up and be counted, or his ever-trusting manager will be in hot water over his poor form."

How will the end of Italian secret advantage influence football in the country?,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-23-how-will-the-end-of-italian-secret-advantage-influence-football-in-the-country/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Tifo Football,2024-01-23T12:03:29.000Z,"Four years ago Italian football became a benefactor of a strange new piece of tax legislation. The growth decree as it was known gave Italian teams the opportunity to offer far larger wages to football players than they could previously afford. However, now the advantage is gone and it will have a huge influence on the future of Italian football. On January 1, 2024, the Italian government declined to extend the growth degree. Let's discuss the meaning of the 'growth decree'. Tifo Football used Roberto De Zerbi's example to explain it. Signing De Zerbi to one of Italy's clubs would be difficult: leaving aside the buyout clause in his Brighton contract, there would be a Premier League salary to match too. The growth decree was introduced to reverse the brain drain caused by talented Italians leaving the country.A tax break helped to entice back the likes of De Zerbi, also making Italy more attractive to skilled foreigners. Anyone in the 48% bracket willing to domicile in Italy, would pay around half of that on their income instead and that is a significant advantage. However, due to changes in politics, the law was repealed. The tax break was one of the few edges that Serie A clubs had in recruitment. Roma, for example, may not have been able to appoint Jose Mourinho in 2021 without a growth decree. The same with Lukaku and his big salaries.  Paring down the growth decree will also make it harder for Premier League clubs to sell into Italy. Abraham, Tomori, Loftus-Cheek and Pulisic transfers to Serie A clubs won't be that easy without this law.  Maintaining the gap between Serie A and Premier League will only become more challenging after losing this edge. The growth decree also influenced such positive things as the competitiveness of Italy clubs in the football arena, attracting brands, social media followers and tourists. However soon it all could change. Despite all the issues the removal of this law creates, there are some advantages too. The clubs won't that encouraged to buy players from abroad, so they will be pressured to develop their young talents. Perhaps these changes will help the Italian national team find new stars"

But it is not the similarities in the playing style of these two players but rather a potentially high price for which Barco could be sold to his next club after showing his skill in Brighton. Seagulls are known for developing young players and then selling them for big prices to the top clubs.19-year-old Valentin is considered to be one of the brightest Argentine prospects. Naturally, he is a left-back but can also play on the left side of the midfield diamond.   Looking at Barco's heatmap of his season for Boca Juniors, you can see that he mostly operates on the left side of the field. However, you can often see him appearing in the middle or even on the right side.                                        FourFourTwo analysed Barco's playing style in their YouTube video. Here are some strengths of the Argentine: creativity, good technique, take-on ability and confidence. Weaknesses: He is not that quick and strong yet.According to FBref stats, Barco is better than other fullbacks of the Argentine football league in most aspects. The take-on stat is especially incredible. He is better than 99% of fullbacks in take-ons attempted and successful take-ons. However, it is not just fullbacks. He is also great compared to midfielders. Barco has an incredible reading of the game: finding space, predicting the game and good timing of his progressive passes. All these qualities are necessary for a world-class midfielder.You can watch some of his skills here. Even with all his abilities, Barco's weaknesses can be a reason for Brighton to send him on the loan. Valentin is still not strong enough for the Premier League, however, knowing  De Zerbi's success with young players, he would have his chance to play for Brighton and perhaps become the future 'Caicedo'.'We know each other': Enzo gives details on his partnership with Caicedo"

With 10 goals and 11 assists after 30 games. You'd think he's a forward, but Grimaldo is only a left full-back who's showing himself to be one of the best in that at the age of 27. Grimaldo has become a massive attacking weapon for Leverkusen thanks to how Xabi Alonso uses him — a fullback with the licence to join the attack and create an overload. He also starts in midfield or on the wings occasionally, just like Joao Cancelo. FBref graph shows Grimaldo is among the top 1% of fullbacks for most attacking statistics — goals, shots, assists, chances created, you name itGrimaldo was bred in Barca's La Masia before leaving for Benfica after being starved of first-team opportunities. Barcelona could've re-signed for free last summer when his contract at Benfica ended but Deco was focusing on other targets like Inigo Martinez, for instance. Plus Barca might've calculated they already had Marcos Alonso and Cancelo. Hence, Barca missed out on a stupendous talent like Grimaldo who is proving to be light-years ahead of any fullback at Barca. Could Barca get him now, though? Not likely. His market value currently stands at €35m on Transfermarkt. Considering Barca's financial predicament they can only stare at him like water under the bridge."

The Players with The Greatest Number of Yellow Cards in the Top 5 Leagues in the World,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-31-the-players-with-the-greatest-number-of-yellow-cards-in-the-top-5-leagues-in-the-world/,Alex,,2024-01-31T09:20:04.000Z,"Regardless of who you support, there is one role that every team has a player for, an enforcer. Some have multiple players for this. Even the teams that are known as ‘nice’ or ‘soft’ will have one or more of these players. And even with the evolution of football and changes in playing style, these destructive players have continued to play their trade on the pitch. Wherever this player plays, this is a player that loves doing the dirty work, running the hard yards, putting the tackles in, but above all, collects yellow cards like they were going out of fashion.  Distinguished Company In the past, we have had the likes of Dunga, Gennaro Gattuso, Edgar Davids, Gilberto Silva, and Jean Tigana, all performing this role to distinction, whether for club or country. The likes of Partick Vieira and Didier Deschamps led their nation to World Cup glory doing their bit for the team. Some are more subtle than others. Claude Makelele, known as one of the best defensive midfielders to grace that position, was one of the more silent operators. The Frenchman, who never won anything with France, could smell danger from the other end of the pitch and had the innate ability to be in the right place at the right time to win the ball back for his team.  But while Makelele was a more silent assassin, there were certainly some players that liked their presence to be known on the pitch, which usually ended up with their names going into the referee’s notebooks. It was not only midfielders of course who would perform this role. The above-mentioned protagonists were esteemed operators in the centre of the pitch, but you did not or do not have to be a midfielder to be able to stick your foot in. The All-Time Greats We have chosen the worst yellow card offenders in the annals of each of the major five European leagues: English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and French Ligue 1. You probably know the names of a few of them off the top of your head, but you might forget about one or two. The regular card collectors are as follows:  Gareth Barry (122 yellow cards in 653 Premier League appearances – one every five matches) The left-footed Englishman, who was capped 53 times by his country, leads the way by some distance for yellow cards picked up in Premier League history. Barry was an all-action midfielder who featured for Aston Villa, Manchester City, Everton, and West Bromwich Albion during a sparkling career. Barry also cements this role at the top of the discipline charts with 6 red cards in his career, level with Joey Barton, Luis Boa Morte, and Nicky Butt in this bad boy club. Detention slips would also have been handed out to Wayne Rooney (102), Lee Bowyer (99, and was infamously sent off one time for fighting his own Newcastle United teammate Kieron Dyer), and Kevin Davies (99), but none of these players got close to dethroning Gareth Barry. Sergio Ramos (174 yellow cards in 525 La Liga appearances - one every three matches) Sergio Ramos, one of the two players on our list who is still playing, has epitomised Real Madrid for a considerable amount of time—16 years, to be exact. He achieved this while playing as the tough-tackling, no-nonsense defender he still is, winning four Champions League trophies, five La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys, four Supercopa de Espanas, three UEFA Super Cups, and four FIFA Club World Cups. Ramos thrives on pressure situations and has received five of his nine career red cards against Madrid's bitter rivals Barcelona. Additionally, Ramos still has time to get more cards after coming back to his first professional team: Sevilla FC. Stefan Effenberg (111 yellow cards in 370 Bundesliga appearances – one every three matches) Effenberg was most known for his two spells with FC Bayern Munich, where he won 3 Bundesliga titles and also captained the team to Champions League success in 2001. The midfielder was known as The Tiger, due to his fiery attitude and tenacious style of football. Effenberg was a leader on the pitch and characterised his leadership with a mixture of doggedness and style. The German possessed a passing range envied by many and was very much the complete midfielder, in the tackle and out of it. Luca Rigoni (101 yellow cards in 303 Serie A appearances – one every three matches) Luca Rigoni is probably the name that would have escaped many if this question featured in a pub quiz. Judging by the yellow card statistics in his time playing Serie A football, Rigoni seemed quite calculated in this side of the game and averaged a yellow card in exactly one in every three matches. The Italian played for a host of Italian clubs but spent most of his Serie A playing days with Chievo Verona. During the 2013/14 season, Rigoni picked up an astonishing 15 yellow cards in just 33 appearances, which ultimately helped Chievo escape relegation. All for a good cause.  Marco Verratti (92 yellow cards in 276 Ligue 1 appearances – one every three matches) As the other player in our roundup that is still playing football, it is quite remarkable that Marco Verratti has accumulated the number of yellow cards he has at the age of 30. With many years ahead of him, Verratti has plenty of opportunity to add to that tally. Since moving to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2012, Verratti has been a constant in the PSG midfield and is never afraid to get stuck in.  Nowadays, the enforcers on the pitch need to be more wary in how they stop the opposition. The introduction of VAR means that players cannot get away with some of the underhand tricks from the past. Over the decades, the ways of picking up yellow cards have also evolved. Yellow cards for time wasting for example means that even the more innocent of players is at risk. But regardless of whether you are a Rodri, Joshua Kimmich, Declan Rice or Casemiro, the role of the enforcer will still need to be played by someone."

But they're only willing to offload the player on loan. Pep Guardiola doesn't see the Englishman as a key part of his first team but Man City are exploring the business side of his departure with multiple teams interested in the midfielder, including Barcelona. The price tag placed on the 28-year-old will likely put him out of reach for Barca. The Blaugrana are known to seek the cheapest options in the market given their Financial Fair Play constraints. Last summer Barca signed Oriol Romeu for €3.2m but even that was not paid fully by the club as reports revealed the midfielder paid some of that fee out of his own pocket. Barca also signed Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez as free agents. It's a strategy they've been using since 2021. Phillips is an all-action defensive midfielder who can also play a box-to-box but there's little to no chance that Barca beats Newcastle and Juventus to sign him. Not at that price. Best way how Barca could line up with Kalvin Phillips"

""Your club needs to decide what it wants. All I am saying is, we are absolutely standing behind the club in saying whatever it is they want, we will facilitate. ""We will be there to make sure that the club is set up for the future."" About talks with Ratcliffe, Burnham added: ""I think there is an exciting potential here, I am talking to the club. I may well be seeing them next week.""Sir Jim has really brought a lot of energy to the situation, Sir Dave Brailsford is a brilliant person and is the architect of British cycling success over the last couple of decades and the velodrome in Manchester — he was very much involved in the building of the velodrome and he is bringing that expertise now to Manchester United."" This comes as welcome news for Man United fans, who have been victims to the Glazers' nonchalant attitude towards improving the facilities that were industry-standard a decade ago.

"Bradley 10, McConnell 9: Liverpool players ratings in Norwich victory",https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-28-bradley-10-mcconnell-9-liverpool-players-ratings-in-norwich-victory/,Aleksei Blokhin,Tribuna.com,2024-01-28T16:47:26.000Z,"Liverpool advance to the FA Cup Fifth Roud after defeating Norwich 5-2 at Anfield. Here's how we rated the players.Bradley: 10/10. A yet another immense performance, provided two lovely assists, for Darwin for the second goal and for Gravenberch for the fifth. Should have had another assist in the middle of the first half but Gakpo failed to score. Was a huge threat going forward and quite solid at the back. He's becoming more than a deputy for Trent, he's becoming a competition. Moved to the right-forward position after Trent came on and did well there too. Showed his work rate, sprinting like crazy late in the game despite playing for the entirety of the game.Jones: 9. Is CuJo Liverpool's most in-form player at the moment? Ran that midfield, scored the opener, connected the defence and the attack, broke the lines with his passing, confused the opposition defenders with his movement. What a player.McConnell: 9. Provided an excellent assist for Jones for the opener with a Trent-esque pass. Great passing in general, also good defensive instincts to close the passing lanes for the opposition.Gomez: 8. Getting closer and closer to scoring each time he plays, nearly broke the deadlock today with an excellent effort from range. Plays on the left as if it was his natural position, composed at the back and dangerous going forward.Jota: 8. Clinical when it mattered, also could have had an assist but Gakpo couldn't score from his pass.Darwin: 7.5. An emphatic finish to give Liverpool the lead. Hit the post earlier, what a goal that would have been.Van Dijk: 7.5. Bullet header to score the Reds' fourth goal.Diaz: 7. Made Gravenberch's goal possible with an insane touch in the build-up.Szoboszlai: 7. Celebrated his return from an injury with an excellent corner assist to Van Dijk.Gravenberch: 6. Poor defending against Gibson for Norwich's equaliser. Nice link-up with Gakpo and Jota on a few occasions but was the weakest link in the Reds' midfield today. Scored his first Liverpool goal in added time.Alisson: 6. Should have saved the Canaries' second goal.Gakpo: 4. Wasted a huge chance early on, another in the middle of the first half and another shortly after the break.

That sounds unimaginable when one thinks of how the Red Devils fared towards the end of last year. The 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur paved the way for better results but in December, the Red Devils lost miserably to Nottingham Forest, West Ham United and Bournemouth. According to The Athletic, Erik ten Hag has changed his approach in training and he's also working on a more open relationship with his players. The report claims Ten Hag and his team are now training players to replicate successful movements in training during games as well. Doing so seems to be working as Man United look like a better-drilled unit than they ever have before. The Athletic further adds that Ten Hag has also held one-on-one sessions with players like Rasmus Hojlund to resolve their issues. Since then, Hojlund has scored five goals in as many consecutive Premier League games. Erik ten Hag: 'The way Man United beat Aston Villa today, I liked it'"

The boss of Bayern Munich will have an eye on him for some day, as well as Real Madrid. It’s going to be a race for Alonso. I don’t think it’ll take place in the summer, but the season after that.”At the moment, Xabi has refused to talk about speculation on potentially becoming the next Liverpool manager because he’s focused on helping Leverkusen win the Bundesliga title.With that being said, it doesn’t seem like the German club’s hierarchy will allow him to easily walk away from the job and might make it difficult for the Reds to rope him in.'I think he will': Carragher makes Xabi Alonso prediction'He knows what he has': Bayer chief makes bullish claim on Xabi Alonso future"

"Hansi Flick at Chelsea: Tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-13-hansi-flick-at-chelsea-tactical-profile-biggest-strengths-and-possible-xis/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Tribuna.com,2024-02-13T22:00:00.000Z,"Chelsea could be looking towards the appointment of a new manager if Mauricio Pochettino is unable to deliver a trophy or secure a European-place finish this season.While Todd Boehly & co have given him enough support for the time being, that could change if the Blues finish the season poorly.German manager Hans-Dieter Flick is currently a free agent and available to manage any top team that gives him a lucrative offer. Here is what Chelsea could look like under the ex-Bayern Munich gaffer.Tactical style and strengthsHansi Flick’s philosophy revolves around dominating possession and a high press style where he urges his players to keep pressing the opponent, far into their own half. The German gaffer loves control, with his Bayern side averaging 60.2% average possession in the 2020-21 season, his final one at the club. This is more than the 58.8%Chelsea have managed under Poch this season.However, Flick is not just about passing the ball around for the sake of it but actually getting things done in the final third. He drills his team to often try to create chances by crossing the ball from the wide areas or deep position to feed the centre-forward.The German manager likes to deploy a 4-2-3-1 formation, something which the current Chelsea side is well equipped for. Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo are slowly creating a solid partnership in midfield, while Conor Gallagher excels in that advanced role.Flick is an expert at unleashing the ultimate potential in his side’s attacking force. His Bayern Munich scored a whopping 260 goals in 86 games and only failed to score in one single match in his reign. A centre forward is the one who profits the most from Flick's system: Robert Lewandowski scored 83 goals in 71 appearances under Flick.WeaknessWith that being said, the major downside of Flick’s system is the defending. He prefers to play a high defensive line, which draws his high defensive line into bad positions. His system exposes the backline to counter-attacks and Bayern often conceded goals  — one goal conceded per game on average, to be precise. There are a few ways that Chelsea can potentially line-up if Flick becomes the next manager. Here we’ll look at one lineup consisting of the current squad of players and another involving some possible new signings.Lineup 1As Flick tends to play in a 4-2-3-1 shape, he’ll probably think of playing all three of Enzo, Gallagher and Caicedo. The Englishman can probably play in that no.10 role and Cole Palmer is best suited on the right, while Christopher Nkunku’s best position is on the left. At the back, because of their passing qualities, Axel Disasi and Levi Colwill should be the go-to centre-back partnership.Lineup 2But as happens with any new manager, Flick will also obviously want some more signings if he was to take over at Chelsea. The biggest problem that needs to be fixed is up-front, where Chelsea are being strongly linked to Napoli forward Victor Osimhen. Seeing how Flick’s system benefits the centre-forward, Osimhen can really thrive under him in the centre-forward role.Flick is also likely to demand a new centre-back signing to add some more composure and leadership qualities in that area. Matthijs de Ligt is reportedly ready to leave Bayern in the summer and he can be brought in to be played alongside Disasi. Another Bayern player whom the German gaffer could ask for is midfielder Joshua Kimmich, who is also rumoured to move in the summer. The German midfielder can play in the defensive-midfield role instead of Caicedo and give Enzo more freedom to create and score goals.❓Would you like to see Hansi Flick managing Chelsea next season?

Playing up-front, Nkunku caused trouble with his movement and hold-up play. Took a few touches to score a brilliant goal and then should’ve had a penalty later on. One can only hope he can constantly keep starting games going forward.Enzo Fernandez – 7Fernandez looked like the only one who was willing to put his body on the line to win duels and dodge the Liverpool press in midfield. Went past the players with some nice flicks, recorded an 82% passing accuracy (68 passes completed) and worked hard defensively with two blocks and five possession recoveries.Carney Chukwuemeka – 7Chukwuemeka added the drive that Chelsea needed after coming on. Made some darting forward runs and forced the opposition players to go back. Assisted Nkunku with a nice pass and showed determination to get the ball forward.Noni Madueke – 4Madueke made under 10 passes and couldn’t create a single chance. Troubled by Andy Robertson and often lost the ball in bad areas. Taken off at half-time.Thiago Silva – 3Thiago Silva looked his age in this chaotic game and couldn’t hold together Chelsea’s midfield shape at all. Caught in bad positions in almost every single Liverpool goal and couldn’t be the defensive commander that the younger players needed him to be.Benoit Badiashile – 3Badiashile actually started the game strongly and saved Chilwell from trouble, but he lost his composure under the intensity. Made to look like a fool for multiple goals, allowing Jota to go through him and Silva for his and being outjumped by Diaz for his goal.Ben Chilwell – 2The Chelsea captain played anything but like one with John Terry looking on from the stands. Chilwell attracted pressure as Liverpool kept creating chances through his side. Lost the ball leading to the second, was booked for a ridiculous dive and was taken off at half-time.The OthersPetrovic – 6, Disasi – 5, Caicedo – 4.5, Gallagher – 4.5, Sterling – 5, Palmer – 5SubstitutesMudryk – 4, Gusto – 6.5, Casadei – N/RLiverpool – Chelsea 4:1 (2:0, 2:1)31 January, 20:15, AnfieldStatisticsLineupsTableAll matchesLiverpool: Becker, Gomez (Robertson 69), van Dijk, Konaté, Bradley (Alexander-Arnold 68), Jones (Clark 83), Mac Allister, Szoboszlai (Elliott 69), Diaz, Nunez, Jota (Gakpo 68)Chelsea: Petrović, Chilwell (Gusto 46), Badiashile, Thiago Silva, Disasi, Fernández, Caicedo Corozo (Chukwuemeka 66), Gallagher (Nkunku 46), Sterling, Madueke (Mudryk 46), Palmer (Casadei 85)Goals: 1:0 - 23  Jota (Bradley), 2:0 - 39  Bradley (Diaz), 3:0 - 65  Szoboszlai (Bradley), 3:1 - 71  Nkunku (Chukwuemeka), 4:1 - 79  Diaz (Nunez)Cards: Caicedo Corozo (11), Fernández (33), Chilwell (35), Disasi (41), Nunez (47), Konaté (76)BOOMERANG.BETN1BETMEGAPARIPARIPESATIPICO888 STAKE BOOMERANG.BETPIN UPPOKERSTARSSportsbooksCasinoBest bookmakersLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...All bookmakers"

The Senegalese midfield destroyer is holding his own at AFCON where he's helped his country win every game they've played so far. Barca might have to fight hard to get him as he recently extended his contract at Tottenham. Yankuba Minteh. This 19-year-old midfielder is another strong option for Barca.

The most prominent one is Miguel Gutierrez.The 22-year-old academy graduate now plays for Girona as he left Madrid on a €4 million deal in 2022. Despite only making ten senior appearances for the Whites during his tenure at the club, Gutierrez has flourished at Girona, becoming a regular starter in Michel's side and even scored against Barca already.Should Madrid opt against pursuing Davies, Gutierrez is the top contender for the role.

Di Maria, one of the most controversial former Manchester United players, also praised Garnacho's rapid development both for the club and Argentina. Speaking to Argentine news outlet Ole, Di Maria said of Garnacho: ""He is a very fast player, he has incredible ability. ""He is going to gain it with experience and coming to the National Team, it is a place where you learn a lot and continue to improve. ""I think he will grow with experience as well. When I was young I wanted to make the play 30 times in the game. Over the years you realise that if you do it 10, but you do it better, it’s worth it.""He has a very big future. It depends on him, on his head, to be able to handle it. I don’t have much to say, there’s a reason he’s playing for Manchester United."" Garnacho is notorious for copying Ronaldo's SIIIUUU celebration, having idolised the player at Man United. However, Di Maria wants the teenager to imitate Messi instead. Di Maria cheekily added: ""The only thing I wouldn’t do is celebrate Cristiano. I would score the goal and I would do like Messi does. I’ll stick with that."""

Andre Onana came close to committing another howler as he came out of the goal to make a save. The ball slipped through his hands and, unfortunately, he clattered into a Wolves player and fell, leaving the goal open. The ball would have gone in with the momentum but Martinez, ever on the prowl, positioned himself well to make a fantastic block.

For the Griezmann goal, he was supposed to track back to help the team defend against the Frenchman — but he was nowhere to be found.Here's the replay of the goal. What is Tchou doing?""Rewatching the game, Tchouameni is clearly my biggest disappointment,"" one fan, Lucas Navarette, tweeted. ""I can forgive your execution being off, but effort and energy should be a given in Real Madrid and it wasn't the case for him last night. Came off the bench and sleepwalked out there.""Strange cameo from Tchouameni last night. For a defensive midfielder who was one of the fresher players on the pitch, this was as bad an error as the other more obvious ones that led to goals,"" the La Pausa podcast added.Another fan, Tezzathekchen, wrote this: ""Tchouameni has been horrible in nearly every big game that was evenly balanced or where his team were outplayed ALWAYS looks completely clueless when caught out in space.""France were a defensive mess at the World Cup because he can’t shield a backline. Slow as f***, takes forever to react, clumsy and lacks defensive awareness in the final third.""Another Madridista, Druchk, tweeted: ""Vini loses the ball, chases Griezman, Tchouameni just jogs and offers ZERO help, unbelievable stuff."""

Rice has fit in perfectly with Mikel Arteta's squad but the same can't be said of Kai Havertz, who also arrived at the same time. The 5-0 win over Crystal Palace was a much-needed comeback but Arsenal have struggled to score goals this season. Before the win, we had 37 goals in the Premier League - the lowest among the top five sides. The five goals have brought that number up to 42 but we are still behind the other top sides. That has to change if we are to win the league someday.

Aston Villa are reportedly looking at a new striker signing, but the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City seem to be happy with their squad.Tottenham Hotspur have already signed Timo Werner and Radu Dragusin in January, and are unlikely to sign anyone else unless able to sell Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg – after which they would need a replacement.The likes of Chelsea and Man United are likely to have a quiet end to the window because they can’t really spend much without breaching financial rules. The two clubs are, however, being linked to potential outgoings -  as Chelsea are reportedly ready to sell Armando Broja and Trevoh Chalobah – while the Red Devils could send Facundo Pellistri on loan.West Ham United were able to sign Kalvin Phillips on loan from Man City, and are now reportedly trying to sign Al Ittihad winger Jota – while Brighton seems satisfied with the signings of youngsters Valentin Barcao and Adrian Mazilu.Newcastle United are reportedly interested in Aston Villa midfielder Jacob Ramsey, but might scoff at the prospect of having to pay £50m for him.While the traditional Premier League top-6 seem to be done with their transfer business, it wouldn’t be surprising if the other teams in the top half of the table indulge in some sneaky last-minute transfers to bolster their chances of competing for a European spot in the second half of the campaign."

Messi scored four: Pep Guardiola's last home game as Barca boss at Camp Nou,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-18-messi-scored-four-pep-guardiolas-last-home-game-as-barca-boss-at-camp-nou/,,Tribuna,2024-01-18T15:29:55.000Z,"Pep Guardiola turns 53 today. His four-year stint at Barcelona brought Cules hundreds of great memories to cherish, here is one of them.His last bowPep Guardiola said goodbye to his home on May 5, 2012. On that day, Barcelona hosted Espanyol. His soon-to-be exit wasn't a secret: on April 27, Pep publicly announced he would leave the team at the end of the 2011/12 season.""Four years is an eternity,"" he explained in a press conference. ""In December I communicated to the president that I felt my stage here was ending. However, I couldn't make it public or tell the players [earlier].""In these four years I have become worn out. I have given everything and I need to recharge. Because of the high demand, I have to move away and recover.""The Barcelona Derby was a perfect match-up for Pep's last home game. Barcelona already secured the 2nd place in La Liga, so there was no pressure on the manager and the team. And Espanyol were a bottom-half team that seemed an easy nut to crack.Giant tifoFans' love for Pep has always been immense. No wonder Cules prepared a special farewell for the boss. A giant tifo with ""T'estimem Pep!"" (in Catalan: ""We love you, Pep!"") on it appeared at the home stand of Camp Nou. There were, of course, smaller posters and banners that channelled the same message.4 record-breaking goals by MessiLike other Barcelona players, Lionel Messi learned about Pep's exit from the April presser. He was shocked:""I want to thank Pep with all my heart for how much he has given me,"" Messi said as cited by Marca. ""I preferred not to be present at the press conference because the media would have sought the faces of the players' grief, and that is something I didn't want to demonstrate.""Messi became a world-class star under Pep and he thanked the boss in the best possible fashion. In the 4-0 win, the Argentinean scored all four goals: one from a direct free-kick, two more from the spot and one after an assist from Adriano.With those four goals, Lionel Messi broke Gerd Muller's record of goals scored in a single season (67) - he ended the season with a total of 73 strikes.Guard of honour for PepAfter the final whistle sealed the 4-0 win for the hosts, the Blaugrana players joined Pep for a dance around the centre circle. Then the team and the backroom staff formed a guard of honour for Guardiola.The entire Camp Nou rose to bid farewell to the legendary coach, the opposition fans not being an exception.Pep's final wordsAddressing the crowd, the departing manager said: ""Life has given me this gift, in these five years we have been able to enjoy the best spectacle. I'm not too different from you. I have been a privileged spectator, same as all of you, just a bit closer to these fantastic players. ""You don't know how much I value being so loved during this time, feeling so loved and so valued during the display today, at all times, during four or five years, day-to-day. You don't know how happy I feel.""Thanks to everyone, especially the ones closest to me who worked hard so that you could have a good time watching us play football. And to the others who haven't been as close, well, I have felt very close. Know that I will miss you all. ""The one who loses is me. I leave you in the best of hands. Know that I leave you with the best players. The belt was squeezing me and I took it off. But you keep it on, because this continues. You'll do well. I wish you the best, and good luck. See you soon, because you'll never lose me!""After those words, the players tossed Guardiola in the air.Pep was in charge of two more Barcelona's games leading the Catalans to an away La Liga draw with Real Betis and the Copa del Rey triumph against Athletic.After that, he stepped off and kept his promise taking a one-year sabbatical before accepting an offer from Bayern Munich."

The midfielder is said to be frustrated with his lack of development at Chelsea and is actively exploring a way out. However, it's hard to conceptualize how Barcelona can land Fernandez considering their financial predicament and the fact that the Argentine is on an eight-year contract at Chelsea. What's more, after Enzo scored the best goal of his Chelsea career on Wednesday when he riffled home a 30-yard free-kick, he celebrated as if to say he isn't going anywhere. Still, we can't rule anything out as we've seen crazier things happen in football. Like Neymar and Messi leaving Barca for PSG.

The referee disallowed a seemingly perfect goal as they dominated Real Madrid in a game that ended 0-1.Two minutes in and the controversy sent fans into a fury in Leipzig. A corner kick in favour of the home team flew very close and Lunin cleared it with his fists.The ball landed on the edge of the area, where Schlager hit it back over the defence which became a perfect assist for Sesko, who headed the ball into the open net.Initially, it looked as though Benjamin Sesko was offside, but the replay showed that Rodrygo kept him in a legal position. So the fans were rightly quizzical when referee Irfan Peljto blew for what was signalled as offside.At the moment Schlager’s volley was sent in, Henrichs, in an offside position, blocked Lunin from behind, meaning that he interfered with play from an ilegal position and, as it ended in a goal, it was disallowed.“He was putting me off, I think you can interpret it as a foul. I don’t know,"" Andrey Lunin said. ""After I punched it, the player shot from the edge of the box.""Then I took a couple of steps forward because I didn’t have time to get back in position and I stayed high so I could react if the ball came back in.

7 players who may be booted out of Man United if Jose Mourinho takes over,https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-31-7-players-who-may-be-booted-out-of-man-united-if-jose-mourinho-takes-over/,Meghna @ 1819,Tribuna.com,2024-01-31T20:35:00.000Z,"There could be an era of the Special One 2.0 at Manchester United if the latest reports are to be believed. Jose Mourinho ended Man United's trophy drought after Sir Alex Ferguson retired, winning the Europa League in 2017. He made an impact as the club's manager until the infamous third-season syndrome struck Mourinho. He was sacked in December 2018 but he's now being primed for a return. If he does somehow return in a Sir Jim Ratcliffe-led era, Tribuna.com takes a look at some players who may receive the boot. Luke ShawShaw had his fair share of troubles with Mourinho, who never believed in the defender's abilities. The duo even had a public fall-out after the former boss made some body-shaming comments following Luke's weight gain. Shaw was close to quitting Man United but stayed on once Jose left. Since then, he's established himself at club and international level. Despite that, it's likely their past issues have not been resolved entirely. Marcus RashfordAlthough Rashford had just burst onto the scene as an Academy gem, he still had his issues with Mourinho. Marcus has admitted to facing a 'tough' time under the Portuguese boss. And now, with all of his disciplinary issues, it's tough to see Mourinho tolerating any of it. With just four goals to his name all season so far, Rashford's future is highly uncertain regardless of whether Jose takes over. AntonyAntony got his first goal of the season against Newport County, having endured a miserable time in 2023/24 so far. With all of his tricks and flicks, Antony often has little to show for in terms of producing numbers. A certain Paul Pogba faced a similar situation under Jose - he arrived for a record fee and then played what was branded 'YouTube football'. That's essentially the kind of football that gets views on YouTube compilations. Antony is kind of similar and has a flaring temper to go. That won't sit well with Mourinho. Andre OnanaFor a manager who likes to park the bus, it's essential to have a solid goalkeeper. Jose had David De Gea the last time around but now, Onana faces the daunting task of filling the Spaniard's boots. Onana has fallen out twice with the Cameroon Football Federation due to lack of game time and alleged disrespect. He also struggles to keep clean sheets, meaning he won't fit Mourinho's requirements. Victor LindelofMourinho has famously remarked that Lindelof lacks aerial awareness. Few could argue that the Swedish defender has overstayed his welcome at Man United. Moreover, Mourinho would now have the services of Raphael Varane, whom he handed his debut at Real Madrid. The duo face quite the reunion, which potentially spells trouble for Lindelof. Anthony MartialMartial struggled under Jose then and there is absolutely no doubt he will face a similar situation once again. The Frenchman has scored just twice all season and has drastically deteriorated - if that's even possible. Injuries and lack of form have led to inconsistency over the years, maybe to the point of no return. Regardless of whether or not Jose comes back, Martial is likely to leave as a free agent once his contract runs out this summer. Aaron Wan-BissakaJose will be reunited with another favourite, Diogo Dalot, whom he hailed as the 'best defender' in his age group when he signed him for Man United. Since then, Dalot struggled only under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer; he's fit himself into the plans of all other managers almost like a chameleon. Dalot has improved massively in all aspects of the game, even adding a goal or two over the years. There's no doubt he will be Jose's preferred choice at right-back."

Both were strong candidates, but the Portuguese lost out to Pep on several points.On the day Mourinho joined Inter Milan, Catalan outlet Mundo Deportivo showed what his Barca XI would've looked like.Valdes; Dani Alves, Puyol, Milito, Maicon; Deco/Essien, Iniesta, Lampard; Messi, Eto'o, Ribery.Just imagine – no place for Xavi, no Sergio Busquets, no Thierry Henry. Iniesta as a defensive midfielder. Maicon, Michael Essien, Frank Lampard and Franck Ribery as new signings. The whole Barca history would've been so different.One thing is certain as both Mourinho and Guardiola wanted to have Dani Alves on their eleven. He ended up joining the club that summer."

With that being said, let’s try to make logic of this situation and show a few ways Chelsea could line up with De Jong.Option 1: With Enzo and CaicedoA lot of questions have been raised on how De Jong can co-exist in a midfield like with Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Well, it is possible. The three can play in a trio, with the Dutchman best suited in the deeper ‘no.6’ role. That means his addition can allow Fernandez and Caicedo to operate as two ‘no.8s’ – with the latter able to play as that energetic ball-winner and the Argentine able to create more chances in a free role.Option 2: In a three-man defenceWith Mauricio Pochettino reportedly thinking of shifting to a three-man backline for Chelsea, De Jong’s versatility means that he can actually play in a centre-back role in such a defensive shape. He has done so for Barcelona and the Netherlands, being able to move the ball around efficiently and also hold his own against strikers.

Но для повышения шансов на успех, рекомендуется проводить предматчевый анализ встречи. одним из ключевых факторов при этом остается состав. Наличие на поле игрока с лидерскими качествами и способного влиять на игру, считается большим преимуществом для команды. В декабре 2023 года составлен список топ-50 самых влиятельных футболистов всех времен. Градации по рейтингу нет. Всех просто расставили в алфавитном порядке. Но мы в этой статье выделим некоторых игроков, которые попали в список.Криштиану Роналду Безусловно, без португальца этот список был бы неполным. Криштиану Роналду внес большой вклад в историю футбола:- 5-кратный победитель Лиги чемпионов;- 5-кратный обладатель Золотого мяча;- Чемпион Европы в составе сборной;- 3-кратный чемпион АПЛ;- 2-кратный чемпион Ла Лиги и Серии А.Это далеко неполный список достижений португальца. Криштиану остается лучшим бомбардиром в истории футбола и продолжает забивать. 2023 год игрок завершил в качестве сильнейшего голеадора, забив 54 мяча, чем доказывает, что на спортивную пенсию ему еще рано. Букмекерская контора Париматч принимает прогнозы даже на индивидуальную результативность игрока в матчах.Лионель МессиМесси в 2023 году получил восьмой Золотой мяч. Этот рекорд способен продержаться вечно. На пару с Роналду Месси был доминирующим игроком в европейском футболе больше десятилетия. Даже отправившись на закате карьеры в МЛС, игрок продолжает выигрывать титулы и поражать фанатов спорта техникой и мастерством. К тому же, Месси выиграл в футболе все возможные титулы, как на национальном, так на клубном уровне, включая Клубный чемпионат мира.Влияние футболиста на команду можно увидеть наглядно. Месси перебрался в последнюю команду в турнирной таблице и стал обладателем Кубка лиг, выиграв с коллективом все матчи. А вот в первой же игре без аргентинца команда проиграла. И такая тенденция наблюдалась не единожды.Диего Марадона и Пеле тоже в спискеПонятное дело, что без Марадоны и Пеле не обошлось. Эти игроки вошли в историю футбола как легенды. Наследие, которое оставили &mdash; просто огромное. Этих футболистов уважает каждый фанат футбола, а в мире почти не найти того, кому неизвестны эти фамилии.Кто еще попал в рейтингМы не будем перечислять всех футболистов, но отметим некоторые известные имена, а именно:- Франц Беккенбауэр;- Дэвид Бекхэм;- Эрик Кантона;- Йохан Кройф;- Рио Фердинанд;- Гарринча;- Тьерри Анри;- Томас Мюллер;- Неймар;- Мануэль Нойер;- Роналдиньо; - Андреа Пирло;- Джейми Варди;- Роналдо; - Зинедин Зидан;- Франческо Тотти.В списке также есть две представительницы женского футбола: Марта и Келли Смит.В список вошли только те игроки, от которых сильно зависели команды и которые влияли на качество игры коллектива. Любители делать футбольные ставки знают, что при отсутствии в стартовом составе футболистов из предложенного списка, часто котировки на команду ползли вверх, так как шансы на успех снижались. Учитывалась не только техника и футбольный талант, но и лидерские качества и другие факторы. Например, одним из представителей настоящих лидеров в предложенном списке является Франческо Тотти."

The Catalan side also scouted Mika Faye – a 19-year-old defender who has been attracting significant attention from clubs in Spain and abroad as one of the most promising young defenders in the game.Barca consider including 'The Monster' Faye in Aleix Garcia deal"

""He’s not the typical lazy forward who wants the ball on a plate. My kind of striker.""

The Polish striker hinted at this again during his chat with Sport.""For me it is better if I play with someone close to me because I have more options to play with one touch or two touches,"" Lewandowski said when asked about Roque. ""If I am with a rival or two very close, I leave free space for others. If we attack with two players it is easier to score goals. From my position, I see many things and maybe I can go to the side because I know that an opponent will always be with me. ""Or I can go outside and there will be room for others. Playing with a player very close, there are more options in attack and inside the area. This is very important because many teams play very defensively, with many players in the area, and we always need a solution. ""With more players in the box, we all have more opportunities to score,"" Lewa concluded. It seems like Lewandowski has the tactical side of his analysis all figured. And this sounds like a clear message to Xavi on the youngster. Both Roque and Lewandowski recently played together in Barca's win against Alaves with the Brazilian bagging his second goal for Barca. Unfortunately, he got controversially sent off, meaning he'd miss Barca's next game. Barca appeals ruling on Vitor Roque red card, final verdict confirmed"

The Bernabeu, the white kit… it has a charm that others don't have. Real Madrid is special.""Beyond that, I don't think I ever fit in. It's not like me.

Elite goalscorer or dark horse? Comparing 4 strikers Chelsea could sign,https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-20-elite-goalscorer-or-dark-horse-comparing-chelseas-potential-options-up-front/,Michael Ellis,Tribuna.com,2024-01-20T17:00:00.000Z,"Despite spending over ₤1bn on transfers since the Todd Boehly-led takeover, Chelsea still need a genuine goalscorer up front.Getting a new striker in January is tough, so any transfer will likely have to be delayed till the summer. However, there are already several players known to be on Chelsea's shortlist.Victor Osimhen and Ivan Toney are known well to a regular Premier League fan, while Viktor Gyokeres is more of a dark horse. Finally, Evan Ferguson is another Brighton player linked with Chelsea barely after breaking through to the first team.Here, we're trying to compare Chelsea's potential signings.Victor OsimhenThe 25-year-old became an elite goalscorer last season, finding the net 26 times to help Napoli to their first Serie A title since 1990. This season, his record is more modest, seven goals in 13 league games.Availability could be a concern, as well as his lack of defensive contribution. Still, if Chelsea want a goal-getter, it's hard to find anyone better.Ivan ToneyAged 27, the Brentford star is older than other Chelsea targets and not an ideal fit for the club's new transfer strategy. However, he is a 20-goal scorer in the Premier League with virtually no weak spots — except his gambling problems.Prior to his ban, Toney has not missed a single game with an injury which should be especially impressive for Chelsea fans.Viktor GyokeresThe Swedish forward is actually six months older than Osimhen, but he has only exploded this season. After joining Sporting Lisbon, he has scored 13 goals and provided seven assists in 20 league games — a stellar form, even if we take the league level into account. Like Toney, Gyokeres has virtually no injury history. In the previous two seasons with Coventry City, he featured in 91 out of 92 Championship games and was an unused sub in the only other match.Evan FergusonThe Irishman is yet to turn 20 years old and has played just 50 games for Brighton, so he's a definition of a raw product.Still, he's already found the net 12 times in the Premier League and outperforms other Chelsea targets in defensive stats. Mauricio Pochettino would appreciate his dedication.Which one do you want Chelsea to sign now or in the summer?"

However, Lineker believes signing a centre-forward is the only missing piece in Arsenal's possible trophy wins. He also suggests signing Victor Osimhen from Napoli as he continues to be linked with a move to the Emirates. Quoted by Football London, Lineker said: ""I would say Arsenal are probably a centre forward away from winning things.""And if I were him [Osimhen], you want to go somewhere where you think you're going to win things.""Now, Arsenal have also had the thing about the financial plans, they've said they can't do anything at the moment, whether they can do in the summer with that amount of money, we'll have to wait and see.

6 Barca players likely to follow Xavi out of Barca — 2 came because he called,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-29-6-barca-players-likely-to-follow-xavi-out-of-barca-2-came-because-he-called/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-01-29T13:56:00.000Z,"When Luis Enrique announced he was leaving Barcelona in 2017, he did it in the aftermath of a game where Barcelona had won 6-1 to cement their place at the top of La Liga. Xavi's case is almost the exact opposite. In his press conference following Barca's disastrous 5-3 defeat at home to Villarreal, Xavi shocked everyone by announcing he would be leaving at the end of the campaign. It was a decision that left a sour taste in the mouth of Cules considering how wobbly Barca have been all season. However, we can imagine Xavi won't be the only one leaving the club at the end of the season. Here are six players expected to leave in his wake. 1. Marcos AlonsoThe Spanish left-back has missed the majority of the season with an injury we can't tell when and how he picked it up. Even before the injury, Alonso was often being left as an unused substitute.Alonso might've found some game time following Balde's hamstring problem but that's not the case. One wonders when Alonso did anything special since he arrived at Barca two seasons ago.The 33-year-old is out of contract in the summer and it's unlikely that Barca renews it. 2. Sergi RobertoRoberto is Barca's captain but he barely leads by example on the pitch. The midfielder cuts across as a player whose best years are behind him. It must be stated that Roberto isn't a bad player. Some even consider him a Barca legend but he's nowhere near Barca's best starting XI even in an underperforming team. Also, Fermin Lopez is ahead of him for impact subs. Like Alonso, Roberto will be a free agent in the summer of 2024 and without Xavi to plead his course his exit is all but sealed. 3. Oriol RomeuBarca were desperate for a defensive midfielder in the summer and decided to pitch their tent with Oriol Romeu. That decision is hard to understand now. Romeu hardly plays regularly and barely impresses when he does feature. The Spaniard would look over at his former team, Girona, and wonder if he'd have emerged as La Liga Champion had he chosen to stay. Reports say a Turkish team is interested in signing him but that may only happen in the summer when the massive clearout begins. 4. Joao CanceloCancelo is only on loan at Barca but there's a hefty transfer fee on his head if Barca intends to make it permanent. The Portuguese fullback has also shown traces of inconsistency despite starting his Barca career like a house on fire. His penchant for overlapping has often cost his team painfully. Without Xavi, a new manager might look at Cancelo and say he's not the type of right-back he wants at Barca. Added to Barca's financial difficulty, it makes Cancelo's continued stay at the club ever so complicated. 5. Ferran TorresFerran Torres joined Barca after receiving a call from Xavi explaining the project and how he intends to use him. Since then, Ferran has been a regular player regardless of all the criticism he faced. The Spanish forward has sometimes repaid his manager's faith like his recent hat-trick against Betis while also underperforming in many others.With Xavi leaving, Ferran might struggle to play regularly under a new manager if his consistency doesn't improve. That would force Barca to cut their losses and sell him. 6. Robert LewandowskiRobert Lewandowski was wanted by numerous clubs across Europe when he felt his time at Bayern Munich was up. Chelsea and PSG pushed the hardest to get him but he chose Barca after Xavi called to convince him. Xavi still keeps faith in the Polish striker despite the fact he's no longer delivering as well as he did last season. With Xavi leaving and Vitor Roque banging on the door of the first team, Lewandowski's time at Barca could end quicker than stipulated in his contract. The big striker is 35 and already achieved everything he set out to achieve in club football. He could decide to follow Xavi out the door and stretch his legs in the Miami sun like Messi and Suarez. There are options aplenty for an accomplished striker to choose from."

The match was filled with intense moments as West Ham took the lead twice, only to see it slip away. David Moyes later fumed over the referee's decisions.Ahmedhodzic and West Ham's Bowen clashed in the box, and the visiting winger ended up on the floor as a result of the altercation.

However, Romano says it's Real Madrid who are likely to sign Mbappe at the end of the day. This is an open secret. The Whites have been chasing the Frenchman for the past five years and would seize this opportunity to finally get their man.

What was he doing there?The 33-year-old now works as a football coordinator with Blaugrana. He is particularly responsible for loans and youth development. La Masia players such as Cubarsi, Fermin and Guiu took part in the Unionistas game so he was taking notes of their progress in the first team.Speaking with the Guardian weeks into his appointment, Bojan said that he wants to focus on the mental part of the game. His own mental health problems dented his rise in football as he struggled with anxiety during his playing career.“Marc Guiu went from 40,000 followers to a million overnight on Instagram,” Bojan told the Guardian in November last year. “That’s madness. ‘How nice, how incredible, a million followers!’ But that’s hard to manage, transformative. With Lamine Yamal, we’re talking about a kid in the fourth year of ESO [secondary school]; we’ve spoken about finishing his schooling. “I don’t want to smother them at a sensitive moment but they know we’re here at their side, that they have the protection they need. You have to let them live it, experience it, accompany them, help them manage it.“In the end, it’s empathy. And in football, it can be hard to empathise with a player, what he is living through. We all want immediate results, to win. It’s a wide world, there are so many interests. They’re exposed. You help them so that they are better players and people.”After emerging from La Masia in 2006, the forward had been on the Catalans' books until 2011. He scored 41 goals in 163 appearances and won three La Liga, two Champions League, two Spanish Super Cup and one Spanish Cup titles. However, he never quite hit the heights expected of him and he had a journeyman career after leaving Camp Nou.Bojan retired at the end of last season. His last club was Vissel Kobe in Japan."

The team performance over the entirety of the game wasn't too good but the Blues go home with a dramatic victory. Here is how we rated the players.Gusto: 8/10. Another time the young right-back can hold his head high despite a poor team display. Really, really good runs, dribbles, crosses and passes. Excellent assist for Gallagher's first goal. Was the best player on the pitch before getting subbed off — he left everything on the pitch.Gallagher: 8. Came in clutch today. Scored an equaliser for Chelsea, getting in the right place to connect to Gusto's cross. And when it looked as if Chelsea were getting only a draw, scored the winning goal in a Lampard-esque fashion.Palmer: 7.5. Anonymous for 90 minutes, woke up in added time and grabbed two assists. Put everything into that run for Chelsea's second goal. Thiago Silva: 7.5. Maybe a bit slow in possession but very solid and reliable at the back. Subbed off after rolling his ankle blocking a dangerous Mateta shot. Great comeback after so much negativity was dumped on him last week.Petrovic: 7. Made a couple of excellent stops. The Lerma goal was unsaveable but Djordje did his best today.Chilwell: 6.5. Was among the liveliest players in a languid Chelsea side in the first half. His runs weren't too useful but at least he put in some effort. Disappeared somewhat after the interval though.Enzo: 6.5. Scored a late goal in style to seal the win for Chelsea. His midfield performance was very questionable though, could have moved the ball forward in a more meaningful way.Sterling: 6.5. Had a good chance to score shortly after coming on but took too many touches and bottled it. Got to give him credit — and a good rating — for an excellent play leading to Gallagher's second goal.Nkunku: 6.5. It's not that he did anything special today yet the team is playing better when Christo is on the pitch.Gilchrist: 6. A decent outing for the youngster after coming on to replace the exhausted Gusto at right-back. Nearly caused a Palace goal at 1-1 when he failed to clear the ball properly.Disasi: 5. A couple of nice blocks but struggled overall. Jackson: 2. One tasty backheel aside, the Senegalese was a ghost wandering the Selhurst Park pitch tonight.Caicedo: 2. Made some really good tackles to win possession for Chelsea. It wasn't enough though as the Ecuadorian's erratic passing is a huge worry. Palace thrived on getting the ball from him. Partly at fault for Lerma's goal.Madueke: 1. Lost the ball leading to Palace's opening goal and absolutely useless going forward.

Will The Saudi Pro League Ever Become A Threat To Europe's Top Leagues?,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-28-will-the-saudi-pro-league-ever-become-a-threat-to-europes-top-leagues/,Alex,,2024-01-28T06:05:24.000Z,"We have all witnessed the Saudi Pro League's incursions in all major European leagues during the summer transfer window in 2023. That has inevitably raised questions about Europe’s ability to remain the global football powerhouse. Of course, all the big football names play in one European league or another, but it seems like the Saudis have made giant strides in challenging Europe’s football domination. Over 30 players have moved over to Saudi Arabia in 2023, and teams there don’t show any sign of stopping. So, should European leagues and teams be worried? Let’s examine this in more detail. Money Simply Talks  The biggest advantage is an obvious one – all Saudi teams are affluent with money, so it is inevitable that some players’ heads are turned.  As is the case when every year ends, sports journalists are busy coming up with a list of the highest-paid footballers, and one could not help but notice that Saudi players dominate there! However, teams in Europe also must take a big portion of the blame. Everyone seems quick to diminish and criticize the Saudis for their spending, but European clubs happily do business with them, which seems duplicitous, to say the least.  Just take a look at the transfer sums that were spent in the summer of 2023, and you will know why we criticize teams as well. Of course, the quality of the Saudi league has risen, which has also attracted more spectators, and more bettors as well! If you think you know all about the Saudi league and want to try out your luck with a couple of wagers, then take a look at our list of reliable bookmakers to do so! The Reasons Against Well, money is a big driving force behind every decision a person makes – regardless of their occupation. Nonetheless, money is not guaranteed to bring you success. The Saudis will have a big impact on transfer dealings in the coming years, but we believe they will fail to overpower Europe because of three main reasons. European Clubs Have Money Well, the Europeans are not short of money themselves! Just a mention of the likes of PSG, Man City, Real Madrid, etc. should be enough for potential transfer targets to know that they are about to get a serious bump in their paychecks. Some argue that the transfer market has not been the same since Neymar’s record-breaking move to PSG from Barcelona- a move that has raised more questions than answers in terms of his impact in Paris. Since then, more than 15 transfer deals have surpassed the $100 million mark, so there is enough money flowing around! Pride and Ambition Not everyone in football cares only about money. There are countless examples of players making their decisions based on pride and ambition. They care about their legacy and they know that if they are to be engraved in football’s folklore, they have to make a name for themselves in Europe. That is the reason why the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane rejected moves to Saudi Arabia during the summer. Players Past Their Prime Lastly, we have the most obvious disadvantage of the Saudi League. Sure, the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Neymar are on jaw-dropping contracts, but we are talking about players who are simply past their prime. None of the so-called big hitters has joined the league at the peak of his powers. Although he won’t admit it, Cristiano Ronaldo’s decline has been obvious in the past few years, while both Neymar and Sadio Mane have left their respective clubs after underwhelming seasons. Let’s not even get started on Jordan Henderson, Fabihno, Edouard Mendy, and Kalidou Koulibaly – all of whom seem to have their best years behind them after disappointing seasons at Liverpool and Chelsea.  Verdict – Legacy is Hard to Buy All in all, we can say that we cannot turn a blind eye to all developments occurring in Saudi Arabia at the moment. Players get astronomical offers, and sometimes, it is hard to reject them.  However, as we have seen with the latest U-turn involving Jordan Henderson, who swiftly came back to Europe after failing to adapt in Saudi Arabia, the grass is not greener there. Saudi Arabia has a big job on its hands – build a legacy that will match the one of European clubs. Until it does so, we cannot see the Saudi Pro League being a threat to Europe!"

From Pitch to Pixels: Soccer's Influence on Online Gaming Culture,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-02-12-from-pitch-to-pixels-soccers-influence-on-online-gaming-culture/,Alex,,2024-02-12T14:37:22.000Z,"Soccer is the world's most popular sport, watched by millions around the world every week. There is no way something this large will not make an impact on global culture, even taking a trip from the real world into the virtual world of gaming.  This is not a new development, as soccer games were among the first developed for home computers during the 1980s. This long-term transition from physical to digital entertainment has not only caught on with soccer fans who want to play the games but also gamers who have developed a love for the sport via the game.  The evolution of video soccer games While many of the early soccer-themed games available were more based on soccer management than the action on the field due to graphical restraints, it didn't stay that way for long. Franchises like FIFA and PES (Pro Evolution Soccer) had real gameplay and have become staples in the gaming industry, with the yearly release of the latest iteration of FIFA regularly topping the charts. The success of these games was partly due to the official licensing, which allowed gamers to become their favorite players and play for their favorite teams. As these titles were joined by others, they made improvements that advanced the gameplay, so it became more realistic rather than just having a pure arcade feel. eSports and online multiplayer soccer games Of course, this took soccer's influence on gaming to new heights. Online options for new soccer games allowed players from around the world to compete against each other, mirroring the same competitive spirit found in the real-world game. Something this popular was bound to grow even further, and before long, online tournaments and leagues formed, which again took the same shape as their real-world counterparts.  The comparison does not end there, as the huge viewing audiences for the real-world version of soccer are being caught up in some areas by those logging into stream coverage of eSports fixtures. These competitions have professional players as well who can also win prestigious prizes even if the salaries haven't quite caught up yet.  Soccer slots and casino games  It's not just eSports where soccer has made its mark on online games; casinos have their share of soccer-related fare as well. If you want to play online pokies in New Zealand somewhere like Jackpot City, then you can get your teeth into the Football Star slot, which also has a deluxe version for enhanced play. It will have all of the smooth graphics and immersive gameplay you would expect from a top casino, as does the card game Match Day or versions of Blackjack or Roulette, where a digital Vinnie Jones is the dealer.  A few final thoughts A global phenomenon like soccer is bound to leak into the digital world and online gaming in all forms has done the sport proud.

Jesse Lingard 'offers' himself to Barcelona - he was once compared to Iniesta,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-17-jesse-lingard-offers-himself-to-barcelona-he-was-once-compared-to-iniesta/,Kingsley_,ESPNDeportes,2024-01-17T08:54:10.000Z,"Former Manchester United and England forward Jesse Lingard has been without a club since being axed by Nottingham Forest in July 2023. But according to ESPN, Lingard has now offered himself to Barcelona. The 31-year-old was once a good player, particularly during years at Manchester United and briefly on his loan spell at West Ham. But overall, it's hard to see Lingard as Barca quality. However, when Lingard started struggling at Manchester United, his former youth coach at the club Rene Meulensteen backed him to get back to his best. Meulensteen drew parallels between Lingard and Barca legend Andres Iniesta.""Jesse had various loan clubs and then he came back,' Meulensteen told The Michael Anthony Show. ""And I think Louis van Gaal was the manager at the time and Louis was very big on bringing young players through and Jesse got the chance to suddenly play in the first team and so did [Marcus] Rashford.""That's the luck that you need and certain managers can see it. Jesse always had attributes in his game as Iniesta had for Barcelona,"" Meulensteen said.One wonders if the attribute the coach was talking about was two arms and a leg. Lingard certainly has those. Anyway, fans on Reddit have been seeing the funny side of Lingard's offer. 💭Walt_Jay: ""Well he’s not a Barca player right now so worst case he will continue not to be.""💭Supplementarytables: ""JLingz inspired me to offer myself to Sydney Sweeney""💭RK99990: ""I'm rooting for you bro 💪""💭MrViksman: ""Lindgard ft.

"Roberto de Zerbi at Chelsea: tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-10-roberto-de-zerbi-at-chelsea-tactical-profile-biggest-strengths-and-possible-xis/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Tribuna.com,2024-02-10T14:00:00.000Z,"Roberto de Zerbi has revolutionized how things operate at Brighton & Hove Albion in recent years and caught the attention of many football fans.Pep Guardiola has hailed him as 'one of the most influential managers of the last 20 years’, a major praise from someone who has won so many titles. De Zerbi has come a long way since helping Shakhtar Donetsk win the Ukrainian Super Cup, becoming the first Italian manager to do so.Fast-forward a few years into his job at Brighton and De Zerbi has successfully transformed them from mid-table scrappers to a highly-entertaining unit. Brighton qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the first time under him and are still going strong despite having to sell major stars like Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo in the summer.If Chelsea were to replace Mauricio Pochettino anytime soon, De Zerbi could be the go-to option because he’s proven in the Premier League and has a distinct, successful philosophy that can get the Blues back to the top.How Does De Zerbi Like His Team Playing Football?Brighton have adapted a possession-heavy style of football under De Zerbi, who likes his players to keep the ball and infuriate their opponents with their swift, efficient passing. The Seagulls have maintained a 3-4-2-1 formation under the gaffer this season, and have boasted 64% average ball possession per game in the Premier League – only behind Man City (66%) in that regard.De Zerbi prefers for his team to play the ball from out of the back, building out from the backline and finding spaces and exploitations in the opponents’ shape to create chances. The Seagulls have created 48 big chances this season, and the Italian side have averaged 11.98 shots per game in the Premier League too.What is most important is that Brighton are clinical in finishing off their chances. They have averaged 1.8 goals per game in the Premier League this season and have scored 42 goals in 23 matches, the sixth-best goal record in the Premier League.Biggest weakness in De Zerbi’s approachThe most prominent issue for Brighton this season has been their defence. De Zerbi likes to play a high defensive line that is often tormented on the transitions and results in poor errors leading to goals. This season itself, seven errors from Brighton’s backline has resulted in goals.The Seagulls also tend to suffer when playing against physical teams who play a low block and willingly surrender possession. Brighton have only kept two clean sheets in 23 league games this season and average 1.65 goals conceded per game.With that being said, De Zerbi’s wonders with Brighton are an indication that he could succeed in getting the best out of this young Chelsea squad and get the club back to competing for major trophies again.  His attractive brand of football, tactical prowess and lively nature can help bring back that spark into the club.If Todd Boehly & co can make it happen, here we will look at two favoured formations of De Zerbi which can be implemented at Chelsea.Lineup 1: With current squadFortunately for the Blues, they already have a couple of ex-Brighton players who excelled under De Zerbi before moving to London. This includes Moises Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Robert Sanchez and Levi Colwill – who all had prolific stints at Brighton in the past.These three are almost locked in to be major players under a Chelsea side possibly managed by the Italian. Because of the formation, Enzo Fernandez can play in a no.8 role with Caicedo in the middle. In the frontline, it’s likely that De Zerbi prefers Christopher Nkunku to lead the line and have Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling behind them to provide that attacking burst and creative spark too.Sanchez, Fofana, Disasi, Colwill, James, Enzo, Caicedo, Cucurella, Palmer, Sterling, NkunkuLineup 2: With potential new signingsIf he takes over Chelsea, De Zerbi will obviously want a few more signings to add more quality to his starting XI. He is likely to demand a new natural centre-forward who can spearhead the attack and add a lot of goals. With the Blues recently being rumoured to be interested in signing Evan Ferguson, that can happen if Boehly & co rope in De Zerbi.Along with that, De Zerbi is also likely to demand the signing of a new centre-back to command his backline. Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt is reportedly open to leaving the club this summer and the Blues could make a move for the quality centre-back, who is excellent in distributing the ball and a sound defender and leader.Going by these potential signings, here is how De Zerbi’s Chelsea could potentially look like.Sanchez, Disasi, De Ligt, Colwill, James, Enzo, Caicedo, Cucurella, Palmer, Nkunku, Ferguson❓Would you like to see Roberto de Zerbi managing Chelsea next season?

However, since Ole's departure, managers Ralf Rangnick and now Erik ten Hag have both opted to play Dalot over Wan-Bissaka.

While the tournament wouldn’t include any European giants (except for Real Madrid and Barcelona) in the early days, the general feeling is that they would eventually agree on joining the project which promises to be way more beneficial for the participating clubs than the existing Champions League.What if the major competition kicked off right now? We’ve emulated the first three seasons through Football Manager 2024 and got some mindblowing results that changed the history of football forever.Fasten your seat belts, we’re getting ready for the takeoff.Season 1Manchester City became the first and only side to win the Super League right after claiming the UEFA Champions League. Paris Saint-Germain finished second while Barcelona completed the top three.The main Super League founders, Real Madrid, only finished seventh and decided to bring back Rafa Benitez to replace Carlo Ancelotti who only knows how to win UEFA tournaments.‘Surprise surprise’Bayern replaced Thomas Tuchel with… Diego Simeone despite staying up in the top division.Almost all the participating Serie A clubs, Inter Milan aside, proved incapable of competing in the Super League. Juventus were so frustrated about it they went for SEAN DYCHE straight afterwards!Erik ten Hag was succeeded by… Quique Setien at the end of the season.‘These cows are now mine’Here are some of the biggest player moves that took place in the first season:Victor Osimhen from Napoli to Chelsea (€71m)Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid to Man City (€26.5m)Rafael Leao from Milan to Tottenham (€70m)Dayot Upamecano from Bayern to Inter Milan (€65m)Theo Hernandez from Milan to Bayern (€61m)Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli to… Real Sociedad (€55m)Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen to Man City (€40m)Leandro Trossard from Arsenal to Barcelona (€40m)Lamine Yamal from Barcelona to River Plate (loan)The number of Man City players in the first Team of the Year is staggering. Bernardo Silva (11 goals, 7 assists) won the Player of the Year while Pep Guardiola was expectedly named the Manager of the Year.Season 2It’s season two and you may spot some surprising new names here: Spurs, Villa, but also Al Hilal with Neymar (now it’s just the Global Super League) and Boca Juniors.Still, the Citizens look unstoppable, but look how high Inter Milan and Mauricio Pochettino’s Chelsea are! Trust-the-process has worked after all?Tottenham look quite hopeless, but wanna know who their manager is?Alright, maybe Saudi clubs actually aren’t that bad after all?Here are some big moves two seasons into the Super League:Dusan Vlahovic from Juventus to Real Madrid (€80m)Serge Gnabry from Bayern to Real Madrid (€57m)Heung Min Son from Tottenham to Real Madrid (stop them please, €42m)Wojciech Szczesny from Juventus to Chelsea (€16.5m)Just a few changes to the Team of the Year which is still dominated by City.This time we see Mo Salah and Kevin De Bruyne here. The Egyptian would actually win two Ballon d’Ors in a row before something absolutely wild happens to him… we’ll reveal it at the end of the piece.Season 3This is where the real madness begins.First of all, Arsenal win it.Secondly, this is the season when Leo Messi is back in European football. You’d never guess who he decided to join…MANCHESTER UNITED! He actually reunited with Quique Setien in one of the weirdest scenarios ever – even for Football Manager. Although he got just three goal contributions in 16 Super League matches, Old Trafford was the place he hung his boots at… what does Cristiano think of it?Cristiano apparently didn’t care much. He was too happy about playing in the Super League where he scored more goals than Leo (three against two) despite dropping back to the second tier (that’s when he retired, obviously).Mysteriously, they both scored in their final encounter against each other. What a beautiful ‘last dance’.Some important movements happen in the managerial merry-go-round at the end of the season:Jurgen Klopp takes over at PSG after some well-deserved restMikel Arteta leaves Arsenal to give way to Zinedine ZidaneQuique Setien says bye to United as Luis Enrique comes inOne thing that left us absolutely stunned is that both Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk decided to join Arsenal before retiring.Nah, it’s barely possible to imagine Liverpool without these two, isn’t it? However, while Virgil van Dijk seems to go nowhere, the Egyptian might very well leave Liverpool at the end of this season alongside Jurgen Klopp.Salah is nearing the final year of his contract. It’s quite likely that if Liverpool don’t cash in on him this year, they will have to let him go for free in the summer of 2025.As of now, Salah’s most likely destination in real life is believed to be Saudi Arabia: our betting partners Megapari rate this move at 2.62 which means a 38.2% probability.The best XI is so different now… and look, all of these Arsenal players are currently part of Mikel Arteta’s squad. They’ve finally shifted City from the throne and did it in style, with Bukayo Saka winning the Ballon d’Or.Dreamers keep on dreaming you say? In reality, Arsenal could make their first step to dethrone Man City already this season - they are going toe-to-toe with the Citizens in the Premier League title race. Besides, in the Champions League, they are rated as one of the top-5 favourites to lift the trophy. Brace yourselves: European nights return next week!"

In doing so, Hojlund is now the second-youngest player to hit five goals in as many games consecutively - only behind the legendary Nicolas Anelka. Anelka is widely regarded as one of the best strikers to have graced the English top flight. It's a testament to Hojlund's talent that he's now in the same bracket. Hojlund now has 11 goals in his debut season at Man United in addition to two assists in the English top flight. Rasmus Hojlund clashes with Douglas Luiz after shushing boos from Aston Villa fans"

Jamie Carragher, who earlier believed the Gunners won't win the title, has now changed his tune - only slightly. Quoted by the Manchester Evening News, Carragher said after the game: ""They [Arsenal] were better than Liverpool in all areas, but the big thing that stood out for me was how strong they were defensively. ""I never felt at any point in that game that Liverpool looked threatening or a goal was coming.""Liverpool got a fortunate goal, we know that. Arsenal do have a slim chance of winning the title, and that chance comes a lot from how good they are defensively.""I think defensively, certainly not just in goals conceded but when you actually look at the underlying numbers, I think defensively they're the best team in the Premier League. You saw that with what Liverpool did yesterday in terms of their actual xG."" Arsenal have had an air-tight defence this season, conceding just 22 goals so far - one of the lowest in the league.

The London club came calling for Cubarsi before he signed his first professional contract last year keeping him at Barca until 2026. The 17-year-old is still available for just €10m the meagre fee in his buyout clause. Barca are said to be working to extend his contract and increase that buyout clause before Chelsea steals their gem. Cubarsi has been Barca's revelation in defence with Xavi trusting the youngster in recent games with Andreas Christensen struggling with his fitness. Thus, we've watched Cubarsi play six matches for Barca in recent times and he's barely put a foot wrong. He also surprised us with his assist against Unionistas in the Copa Del Rey round of 16. If Barca doesn't work quickly Chelsea could get Cubarsi without much fuss. They have so much money to spend after spending an excess of €1 billion in the last three transfer windows. Hence, they could easily turn the head of the youngster with money. 'One of the best weeks': Cubarsi opens up on making La Liga debut"

""As a a squad we have to replace him and we have players who can play there and will play there."" In Licha's absence, the onus falls on Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof to handle the defence. There is also Luke Shaw, who can play at centre-back if needed. There is no denying Licha's quality on the ball when he does play; his fighter's mentality is, of course, one of his biggest advantages. Every time he's injured though, he returns stronger and this time should be no different.

The draw takes them to the League Cup final after the first leg ended in a 2-1 win for the Reds. Here's how we rated the players in today's game.Diaz: 8. Scored a brilliant goal, even if took a few deflections to get past Leno. Was actively involved in the game, creating danger with his dribbling and movement.Gomez: 8. Didn't put a foot wrong, Robbo will really have to fight to get his place back. Made two excellent blocks, added physicality going forward. You can probably ask him to play between the sticks and he'll put in a shift. Quansah: 7.5. Rock solid at the back, spraying his long-range passes beautifully, getting an assist. Can't believe he's just 20 years old.Elliott: 7. Looked determined to score to shush the home crowd which was booing him. It didn't happen but a positive performance from Harv anyway, made things happen in the midfield. Excellent pressing as well. Looked gassed after 70 minutes.Mac Allister: 7. His performance didn't really catch an eye but Liverpool lost control of the game when he came off. The Argentine was really crucial in keeping possession and breaking down Fulham's attacks.Gravenberch: 7. Moved the ball forward really well, made a lot of interceptions. Really should have scored late in the first half after a breathtaking Elliott cross. Still, put in a very decent shift.Kelleher: 6. Made several nice stops today but failed to claim a cross early in the first half, leading to Fulham's best chance of the game. The post spared his blushes. Doesn't give you the composure that Alisson gives.Darwin: 6. Failed to score but not really his fault: for some reason, Leno turns into a beast when Nunez takes a shot. Probably his biggest mistake today was not spotting Diaz's run and playing Elliott instead of Lucho on the break early in the second half.Van Dijk: 6. Could have done better when Fulham equalised, he simply let Diop run past him.Bradley: 5.5. Very decent going forward, even if he could have done better with the accuracy of his crosses sometimes. However, needs to work on his defending. Willian often got the better of him in the first half and Conor is chiefly at fault for Fulham's equaliser as he bought into a Wilson trick.

While Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate remain first-choice options, the emergence of the Jarell Quansah – who has helped the club keep four clean sheets in seven starts – has helped ease the need for an emergency centre-back signing.Liverpool confirmed to be interested in signing Colombian defender Kevin Mantilla - who is he?"

"3 new signings, Yamal as striker: How Barcelona could line up under Jurgen Klopp",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-26-3-new-signings-yamal-as-striker-how-barcelona-could-line-up-under-jurgen-klopp/,Kosta König,Tribuna.com,2024-01-26T19:28:05.000Z,"Many Barca fans are dreaming of Jurgen Klopp's Blaugrana takeover following his decision to leave Liverpool after nine years.The German has clarified he would love to distract from coaching for a year, so we've imagined what his Barcelona lineup could be in 2025.Goalkeeper: Marc-Andre ter StegenHaving a reliable shotstopper is crucial – Klopp could spend hours recalling how Alisson saved his team multiple times during games.MATS is just 31, so he surely has a few years of quality football ahead.Right-back: Joao CanceloLike Trent Alexander-Arnold, the Portuguese is way more helpful offensively than defensively – he would be one of Barca's main creators under Klopp.Centre-backs: Ronald Araujo and Jules KoundeAraujo and Kounde are two outstanding defenders, no way Klopp would give up on any of them, even despite their recent form.If the two recover their best form, they will be even more solid than prime Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk!Left-back: Alejandro BaldeThe left-back's actions on the pitch may seem too straightforward, but that's exactly what Klopp needs to emulate the success of his Liverpool team.Balde would really need to improve his crossing, though, to be compared to Andrew Robertson.Defensive midfielder: Douglas LuizRecently wanted by Liverpool, the Aston Villa star has also been linked with Barcelona as Deco is said to be a big fan of the 25-year-old.The Brazilian would be a massive addition as he's a midfielder Barca need: physically-gifted, vital in the build-up play with his forward runs, passing and long balls, important on set pieces.Central midfielders: Gavi and PedriDouglas Luiz aside, Jurgen Klopp would need even more combative midfielders on his team. Gavi could be the key player of his project as the one who covers plenty of space and wins lots of duels every time.As always, Pedri would complement him well in a more creative role.Right winger: Mohamed SalahMo's current deal with Liverpool is up in 2025 and it's unclear yet where the Egyptian King will end up afterwards despite the recent Saudi links.Taking Salah to Barcelona means Klopp would get Blaugrana the first ready-made superstar since Leo Messi. Even if in the short term, this would be a boost on all levels.Left winger: Luis DiazThe Colombian's father has revealed his son's dream of becoming a Barca player one day – Klopp's arrival would be the best time to fulfill it.Sometimes it feels Diaz's spark is what Blaugrana need on the left wing: pacy, skillful, with an ability to win duels against any defender, Luis can be really crucial to this team.Striker: Lamine YamalIt's not necessary to be an incredibly-prolific striker to play under Jurgen Klopp.Like Roberto Firmino, the youngster would play an important role in the buildup and focus on improving chemistry with the other forwards, forming an unstoppable frontline trio.Barca XI: Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Gavi, Douglas Luiz, Pedri; Salah, Yamal, Diaz."
'More than I originally thought': Riyad Mahrez's wife Taylor Ward reveals what Saudi Arabia is really like,https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-14-more-than-i-originally-thought-riyad-mahrezs-wife-taylor-ward-reveals-what-saudi-arabia-i/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,Daily Mail,2024-02-14T13:48:40.000Z,"Riyad Mahrez made an unexpected move to the Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli from Manchester City last summer. However, it appears that the shock was not limited to his fans, as his wife, Taylor Ward, was also caught off guard.In a revelation during Amazon's new series 'Married To The Game', Taylor Ward shared that she was on a beach holiday when Mahrez called her to announce the sudden move to Saudi Arabia the next day. A clip from the series, capturing Ward's emotional reaction to the news, has gone viral. Tearfully, she expressed her concern about being alone at home, to which Mahrez responded, ""It's part of the game, innit.""In a special interview with the Daily Mail, Ward shared insights into her life in Saudi Arabia.""So far, the experience has been amazing,"" she said. ""There's obviously no alcohol so I won't be having a glass of wine! To be honest, there's more there than I originally thought. When I went on my first trip, I saw a Nando's. I was just like 'I'm so happy they've got Nando's'.""""The vibe is just very different. It's a lot more chilled out there, it's quieter and calmer, whereas in Manchester life is so busy - there's so much going on and we're always going out for dinner and seeing friends. That's probably what I'm missing the most, seeing family and friends rather than what the country is missing.""""The people have been so lovely - I think that was actually a massive shock, how nice everyone has been. You can't compare it to the UK - it's nothing like here. I'm enjoying it so far, it just feels like I'm on holiday, I don't feel like I've moved there yet.""Families of players joining Saudi clubs often worry about the gender segregation rules in the Gulf State. In the past, Mail Sport reported an incident where the wife of a player, who had joined a Saudi club, was hissed at in a shopping center for wearing shorts.Despite these concerns, Ward reassured that the rules are starting to become more relaxed.""I think it depends on where you go. At the moment they're looking at relaxing these rules. From what I had heard, I was worried about that stuff when we first went, but it's surprised me. It's more relaxed from what I was first told.""""I'm not just saying this, I actually really like it. I can't fault it so far, we've really enjoyed it. We've just got our house here so I'll definitely be staying in Jeddah and won't be going anywhere else.""""It's got beautiful beaches, shops, restaurants. I don't think there would be any need to move anywhere else. I'll be in Jeddah for the foreseeable that's for sure.""'I said, ""Mahrez is leaving, you're going to get a chance""': Pep explains Palmer exit"

This is because they need to raise €43m to sign the striker.Last summer, Chelsea made an agreement with Lukaku. The agreement is that this would be his last loan and he would leave permanently in the summer, with the Blues setting a €43m asking price.Roma would have to sell one or two players in addition to qualifying for the Champions League to meet Chelsea's price.The 30-year-old has scored 15 goals and provided two assists in 26 appearances for the Serie A side so far this season."

To raise money for the signing of Leao, Barca could be open to selling players like Jules Kounde, Frenkie De Jong and Ronald Araujo. Barcelona will also be hoping to sign a midfielder in the summer to cover their defensive midfield position and the possible exit of De Jong.

'Would have a dual role': Man United fan names interesting new role for Mount next season - we draw it in lineup,https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-27-would-have-a-dual-role-man-united-fan-names-interesting-new-role-for-mount-next-season-we/,Uttiyo Scarnage,Redcafe,2024-01-27T21:14:00.000Z,"Mason Mount is gearing up to make his return from injury for Man United after being on the sideline for multiple months with a groin issue.The Englishman is aiming to be fully fit and available for the Red Devils for the final few months of the campaign after enduring a really tough start.However, one Man United fan on Redcafe ‘Ikon’ believes that perhaps moving him into a different role next season could help get more out of him.The fan commented: “Personally, I don't think that we can afford to persist with Antony on the right. I'd put Mount in as an attacking right sided attacker, he would have a vital dual role, and a new CM in the middle.”Basically, the Man United supporter is indicating that Mount should be played on the right – but in a much more narrower role than Antony or any traditional winger. It must be noted that the Englishman has had the experience of playing as a right-winger, having done so at Chelsea. In this narrow role, he would basically cover duties on the wings, link up with Diogo Dalot and also add more energy and creativity by trying to move into central areas to get among the goals.Going by this supporter’s vision, here is how Man United can look like this season and next season with Mount replacing Antony on the right.3 best pics as Mason Mount works hard in Carrington gym'A team that's struggling and has negativity': Frank Lampard explains Mount's struggles Man United"
The 2023 Premier League Disappointment,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-28-the-2023-premier-league-disappointment/,Alex,,2024-01-28T06:01:57.000Z,"The American sports portal ESPN has presented its traditional selection of disappointments in the English Premier League. The Ukrainian winger of London's Chelsea, Mykhailo Mudryk, is also included. A little more than a year ago, the most expensive and talked-about transfer in the history of Ukrainian football occurred. Mudryk was marketed as an exceptional football talent, standing among the world's most accomplished players. The best clubs in the Premier League fought for him, and the expectations of him were sky-high. But in a year of playing for Chelsea, Mudryk has fallen to the year's disappointment. Who is Mudryk? Mykhailo Mudryk is a Ukrainian football player who plays winger for Chelsea and the Ukrainian national team. He was born on January 5, 2001, in Krasnograd, Ukraine. He began his career at Shakhtar Donetsk. In 2019, he debuted in the Ukrainian Premier League with Arsenal Kyiv. In early August 2020, he joined Chernihiv Desna until the end of the 2020/21 season. Mudryk quickly became one of the most promising young players in Ukraine. In the 2021/22 season, he scored three goals and provided nine assists in 19 games for Shakhtar. In the 2022/23 season, he became the fastest player in the Champions League group stage and was named one of the top 10 dribblers in the tournament. In 2022, Mudryk was named the best Ukrainian footballer. In the first half of the season, he played 18 games, scoring ten goals and providing nine assists. In January 2023, Mudryk joined Chelsea for €70 million (€100 million with add-ons). He signed a contract until 2031. You can follow Chelsea team matches, game predictions, and statistics on bookmaker sites. At https://stavnice.bet/, you will find reviews of reliable world bookmakers. Mudryk is a versatile midfielder who can play on either the left or right wing. He has good speed, excellent dribbling skills, and strong technique. Footballer's failure in his first year at Chelsea Note that we in no way call Mudryk a bad footballer. We are trying to understand why a well-known American publication included the Ukrainian in the list of disappointments. A year of adaptation is enough to get used to a new country, learn the language, and resolve everyday matters. There is also plenty of time to get along with a new team. In addition, Mudryk managed to train under two Chelsea head coaches, make his debut in the Champions League playoffs, play against English teams, and be in the reserves and the starting lineup. The footballer was admired and criticized; he went through a real school of life.  Here are the arguments why Mudryk is the disappointment of 2023: - The first match against Liverpool made Mudryk famous, but everything went wrong. Only after a couple of months, in the 7th match against Leicester, did the Ukrainian distinguish himself with an assist on Kovacic. - Mudryk played 38 matches out of 50 possible for his club. But the playing time indicator is impressive in a negative sense. In the Premier League this season, Mudryk appeared in less than half of the total playing time, and in the League Cup, only 24%. It is not the result that is expected from him. - In only 38% of matches, Mudryk started on the field. It only suggests that he still has a long way to go before reaching stability. - Four goals and four assists – that's all Mudryk did for the whole year playing for Chelsea.  - After a couple of months after the transfer to Chelsea, Mudryk fell in price by almost a third. Things could be going better for the Ukrainian footballer. We do not set out to criticize Mudryk as a footballer. Enough time has passed for adaptation, but he is only 23. Let's wish him success in football matches and greater effectiveness in the new season. You can support the footballer and view the statistics on the website of the online bookmaker Ivibet SI.

I would rather watch Mudryk every week than watch Sterling sitting on the bench.”Dodge: “For the love of god, please put Sterling on the bench.”Oladimeji: “For the love of God, can poch bench this sterling forever.”Mbi50n: “Sterling needs to f*** Off for the rest of the season. Bench the c*** for all I care. He doesn’t give a f*** about Chelsea.”Arjun: “Sterling the player reminds me of Rafa Benitez at Chelsea. I don't think there's a single person out there who thinks he deserves to even be on the bench. But the coach keeps two keepers on the bench instead of a €20M striker so.”Buzi Brown: “If Jose was the manager of Chelsea, Raheem Sterling would not even smell the bench for the next five games but Poch who picks players based on merit keeps starting him week in and out.”'We can't catch a break': Chelsea fans infuriated with manner of goals conceded as Wolves take leadPalmer – 8, Sterling – 4: rating Chelsea players in Wolves loss"

Only one player Real Madrid should sign from amazing Girona team — he's just embarrassed Sergio Ramos,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-25-only-one-player-real-madrid-should-sign-from-amazing-girona-team-hes-just-shown-sergio-ra/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-02-01T07:32:00.000Z,"Imagine you're Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid, the biggest football institution in the world. You need a new striker and Kylian Mbappe flatters to deceive only to bag a hefty contract in Paris. Meanwhile, Joselu will be 34 next year and frankly not clinical enough to lead the club into greater glory.You glance at the league table and you spot a small club in Catalonia punching well above their weight. Girona currently leads La Liga with a one-point gap on your beloved Real Madrid, although they've played one game more.This Girona are propelled by a beastly Ukrainian striker who goes by the name Artem Dovbyk.The powerful six-foot-two tall striker recently caught up with the sensational Jude Bellingham in the race for the Pichichi by bagging a first-half hat-trick against Sevilla. In doing so, Dovbyk grossly embarrassed Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos, making him look every bit his age. The iconic defender simply couldn't live with the ferocious Dovbyk as he watched him score a hat-trick in just 6 minutes. The question you'd be asking yourself Mr Florentino is, do I keep chasing my tail with Mbappe or go all out for a La Liga-proven ferocious striker like Dovbyk?Whatever your answer to that question is, Dovbyk is one player from that amazing Girona team who could immediately fit Real Madrid like a glove. He's not perfect, but he'll certainly fit.If Real Madrid sign Mbappe at the end of the season, Carlo Ancelotti or whoever is in charge next season must decide whether to play the Frenchman in his preferred left-wing position and bench Vinicius. Or play Mbappe as centre-forward, a position he doesn't fancy, to allow Vini to carry on playing on the left. The right wing is not even in question, neither Vini nor Mbappe will play there with a smile on their face.With Dovbyk, there would be no such debate, the gaffer simply has to switch to a 4-3-3 with Vini and Rodrygo playing on either side of the beast. Bellingham would still have the freedom to provide the overload from the number 10 position and Real Madrid will have a monstrous attack all day long.The only major drawback with Dovbyk is that he prefers to play as a focal point in attack. Real Madrid thrives on strikers who can be more involved in the build-up, dropping deep for the ball and roaming across the final third to avoid being isolated by the defence. Karim Benzema was the perfect example.Stats show that Dovbyk isn't the best passer of the ball out there. Over the past year, he's not been among the best 50% of strikers for passing-related stats, as shown in the graph by FBref below.It tells you Dovbyk is a player like Erling Haaland, another striker who has been heavily linked with Real Madrid. The 26-year-old excels in tight spaces. He can hurt any opposition in the blink of an eye with a powerful shot with his preferred left foot while also being super deadly in the air.What's more, Real Madrid won't have to break the bank to sign Dovbyk in the summer. The player should be elated if Real Madrid calls his agent, unlike Mbappe or Haaland, both of which are practically out of reach.Girona paid €7.75m to sign Dovbyk from Dnipro last summer. Agreed, his market value has gone up since then with Transfermarkt putting it at €28m, but that's nowhere near the mind-boggling millions being quoted to sign and pay Mbappe.Over to you. Would you sign Artem Dovbyk if you were Florentino? Meanwhile, get to know the Ukrainian Hulk even better with a video on our YouTube channel:"

Brighton are already in talks with Leicester for Dewsbury-Hall, 25, but The Athletic understands there is a gap between their offer and what the Foxes are demanding. Leicester want at least £30 million for the talented midfielder, who has smashed nine goals and assisted nine more already this season. If Brighton refuse to meet their valuation, Arsenal could make a move. The Athletic also adds that Edu believes Dewsbury-Hall is just what the Gunners need. However, Arsenal have their hands tied from signing him this month, thanks to Financial Fair Play restrictions. Knowing what Dewsbury-Hall is capable of, Leicester are not likely to accept anything below £30 million; that's still a pretty modest fee. If the Englishman does end up joining Arsenal, here's how he'd fit Mikel Arteta's XI. Alongside Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard, Dewsbury-Hall could slot in as the perfect creative addition. He's adept at scoring and assisting, meaning he'd work in tandem with someone like Odegaard. Considering we play with a striker like Gabriel Jesus, who is more known for his work rate off the ball, Dewsbury-Hall could cook up some magic."

But why is that so? Relevo explains. Real Madrid no longer views Barcelona as a serious competitor both on the pitch and financially. They say Barcelona have enough problems already with their huge debt and Financial Fair Play restrictions and Real Madrid shouldn't add to them. Madrid also firmly believes that Barca can no longer compete against them in the transfer market with their current problems. For example, Real Madrid easily paid €100m for Jude Bellingham and did so a summer ago for Aurelien Tchouameni. Real see this as the price set for quality players nowadays, with players like Josko Gvardiol (€90m), Caicedo (€115m) and Enzo Fernandez (€105m) being prime examples. Barca can't compete on that front as the Blaugrana pursues players they can sign for free. What's more, Real Madrid doesn't want more problems for Barca as the Catalans remain their only ally in the Super League project. They would rather see Barca survive financially and help them make the Super League come true than be buried forever under a mountain of debt. Real Madrid did not officially respond to Barca president Joan Laporta when he accused Los Blancos of piling pressure on referees to get them to whistle in their favour. Real Madrid have beaten Barca on the two occasions they've met in El Clasico this season but that wasn't the case last season when Barca won the league and Super Cup comfortably.

During the 18/19 campaign, he only played four games with a full 90 minutes on the pitch, and the situation got progressively worse up until his final season in a white shirt.Competing with the iconic trio of Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, Isco struggled to secure a spot in the starting lineup.After parting ways with Los Blancos in summer '22, the player faced an unsuccessful stint at Sevilla that saw his contract terminated after just six months. Another six-month period without a club followed, but his fortune changed when he signed with Betis last summer. Undergoing a career revival, Isco has already bagged 11 goal contributions in 27 games for the Andalusian side, including an impressive brace against Barca last Sunday.Reflecting on his challenging journey, Isco candidly admitted to Movistar: ""I was so angry back then. I thought it was everyone's fault but mine. But time gives you perspective.. Now I realize there are things I could've done differently and should've fought more for my spot. At that moment, I was lost and didn't want to prove myself. I constantly felt down, lacking the mental strength to reverse the situation. I felt like a victim, and I actually wasn't.""

The Glazers are notorious for running operations remotely, delegating most of the important tasks to senior officials. And the Daily Mail understands there is no proper authority to take the tough decisions. One example cited by the Daily Mail is it's not been uncommon for more than one scout to show up at the same game for Man United. The entire process needs streamlining to run more effectively.

Arsenal potentially stand the chance to sign the French World Cup winner for free, with Real Madrid reportedly out of the race. If Edu can pull off the blockbuster transfer of the summer, here are three ways the Gunners could include Mbappe in their starting XI. 2-striker formationThe first option sees a midfield diamond deployed with Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli positioned a little deeper than usual. Up top, there is Mbappe alongside Leandro Trossard, who has a creative flair. Add Martin Odegaard to that mix and this could be a lethal combination that guarantees goals from several players for Arsenal. Sole striker This option is quite simple - Mbappe replaces Gabriel Jesus as the striker up top, with Martinelli and Saka on the wings. The midfield and the defence remain the same; this could be a great way for Mikel Arteta to play when an injury befalls Jesus. As a wingerMbappe is also adept at playing on the left wing, meaning he could be deployed there. However, doing so would make life very difficult for Martinelli as he may spend most of his time on the bench. The combination of Mbappe and Saka working together down the wings sounds very tantalising. Also, Oleksandr Zinchenko's creativity down the left side could land goals on a silver platter for Mbappe.

His contract ends in 2025 so Bayern wouldn't be too reluctant to sell him.Mohammed KudusThe Ghanaian has made himself known to Premier League fans since his arrival at West Ham this season, scoring 6 league goals along with 3 in the Europa League and 1 in the Carabao Cup.Kudus is only 23 but the talent is very clear to see. Unlike his Ajax teammate Antony, who has flopped at Man United, Kudus took to the Premier League like fish to water. His work rate in incredible and his goals are usually pretty spectacular.The Ghanaian is valued at €50 million according to Transfermarkt.com but the Hammers will be hard to buy from, given his performances continue to raise his stock.Michael OliseOlise is one of the most exciting young wingers in the Premier League with the joint-highest dribble success rate on this list.His hamstring has been a bit of an issue for the Crystal Palace player recently and he is currently out for two months with that injury. He has already missed 13 games earlier this season due to a hamstring injury so that could be something for Liverpool to consider.At his best, Olise is a great ball carrier and has the finesse to finish and create chances for his teammates.RaphinhaBrazilian winger Raphinha had a couple of impressive seasons at Leeds and scored 11 goals in the 2021/22 season, which earned him a move to Barcelona.He hasn't been as impressive at Barca but he still managed 7 goals and 7 assists in La Liga in 2022/23.This season Raphinha has 3 goals and 6 assists in all competitions but has been plagued with muscle injuries. He missed 4 games in October and has missed 8 more over the past month due to his muscle injury.Pedro NetoNeto is the driving force behind Wolves' season so far and is third on the assists chart in the Premier League this season.Neto is an electric dribbler and is great at crossing as well. His defensive work rate is something he will have to work on but his creativity will pose problems to any defence.His value, according to Transfermarkt.com, is the lowest on this list and he may be more attainable than the others."
Ancelotti makes 'final decision' on who should replace suspended Jude Bellingham,https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-24-ancelotti-makes-final-decision-on-who-should-replace-suspended-jude-bellingham/,Kingsley_,Marca.com,2024-01-24T10:41:36.000Z,"Carlo Ancelotti has made the final decision to start Brahim Diaz in place of Jude Bellingham in the game against Las Palmas this weekend, according to Marca. Bellingham picked up a yellow card in added time during the game against Almeria last Sunday. That took his bookings tally for the season to five which meant a one-match ban. Bellingham's combative style of play makes him susceptible to yellow cards which explains why he has already been cautioned nine times in all competitions this season. However, Real Madrid will sorely miss the Englishman considering what he brings to the team in terms of work rate and goal contributions. Jude has already scored 18 goals plus 8 assists in 26 games this season. Bellingham has missed just four Real Madrid games this season, twice due to injury and for rest. Meanwhile, Brahim presents an exciting proposition to help Real Madrid's attack. The Spaniard has scored six goals and a further three assists in his 23 appearances so far. The only slight worry with Brahim is that he's unlikely to offer as much as Bellingham defensively.Girona striker catches up with Bellingham: Updated La Liga topscorers rankings"

The swift appointment of Roma legend Daniele De Rossi as the new manager added a layer of complexity to Mourinho's exit.According to Stefano Carina via TMW, Mourinho's gesture of leaving the ring behind symbolizes his feelings of betrayal by players and higher-ups in the club. The Conference League ring, received after Roma's triumph over Feyenoord in May 2022, was a significant memento, marking the team's first trophy in 14 years and Mourinho's fifth European title. To emphasize the point, Mourinho reportedly placed the sentimental ring in the locker of Roma's captain, Lorenzo Pellegrini.That's not all though as it's claimed that Mourinho also left a message, which read: ""When you are men, give it back to me"".José Mourinho spotted leaving Roma's training camp for one last time"

If Xavi fails to win it his future could be up in the air. However, Xavi's team are also expected to compete well in the other two competitions regardless of what the eventual outcome is.

""There is a player out there and if he’s doing all that stuff and producing magic, you almost forgive him but if you’re in a struggling team [Man United] and you’re doing all that stuff, that’s where it stands out and you go ‘you’re killing us, you’re costing us’."" Keane also made an unflattering comparison with Paul Pogba, adding: ""I always used to describe Pogba a bit like this – I think there’s a difference between a great talent and a great player. ""Pogba was a great talent, but I didn’t think he was a great player and the same with Bruno Fernandes.""No doubt the talent is there but there’s just something [missing] and the great players, it’s in their head of where they need to be whether it’s defensively or to receive the ball."" Bruno has often come under flak for his misplaced passes and also his emotional outbursts with referees. The captain has scored five goals and assisted five more across competitions this season. While his goal output has reduced compared to other terms, Bruno is still a key member of the squad. Like always, he's among the players with the most minutes and also one of the first names on the team sheet. He must be doing something better than Pogba.

This is normal. I understand very well how things work in these individual awards. They are based on marketing, money and advertising.

What's even more worrying is that Nacho has been disappointing despite the numerous opportunities he's been getting due to injury plaguing Madrid's defence. It means that Ancelotti may have to make a big call and play Aurelien Tchouameni in his defence. The last time the French midfielder played there, against Alaves, Madrid kept a clean sheet.

The Basque boss won the 2019/20 Copa del Rey and surprisingly finished fourth with Real Sociedad last season, subsequently reaching the Champions League last 16 for the first time in 20 years.While he says he’s living a happy life at Real Sociedad, Barca reportedly have been in contact with the 52-year-old in recent weeks. Here is what he may offer the Catalans next season.***Alguacil is a really flexible coach who has tried plenty of different formations since taking over in the Basque Country. One of his most popular picks is the 4-4-2 diamond that would suit today’s Barca side quite well.Imanol has made the most out of his starting centre-back pairing, even turning Robin Le Normand into a permanent starter for Spain. His full-backs are normally the weakest defensive links, but at least he has made them a dangerous offensive weapon after the club signed Arsenal’s Kieran Tierney and Rennes’ Hamari Traore to reinforce both wings.Alguacil puts much emphasis on the midfielders as a main creative force, so his team is usually pretty much possession-based (55.2 per cent on average this season). Martin Zubimendi, Mikel Merino, Brais Mendez and Takefusa Kubo have all turned into one of La Liga’s best players largely thanks to Alguacil’s impact. Given how well he works with domestic talent, he would obviously be thrilled to coach players like Pedri and Gavi.Up front, Alguacil prefers to have two forwards, one of whom covers plenty of distance and connects the midfield with an out-and-out striker – Vitor Roque or Lamine Yamal could do this job perfectly.Let’s take a look at the potential line-ups.Line-up 1Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, Inigo, Balde; De Jong; Gavi, Pedri; Gundogan; Lewandowski, Roque.The best-available option if Barca make no new signings – and surely with former Real Sociedad player Inigo Martinez as a starter.Line-up 2Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, Cubarsi, Balde; Zubimendi; Gavi, Pedri; Kubo; Lewandowski, Yamal.Alguacil just has to bring Zubimendi to Camp Nou if he takes over at Barca – the defensive midfielder is among Blaugrana’s hottest targets and has been on fire under the Basque boss.Another big signing might be Takefusa Kubo who was reportedly wanted by Xavi last year. Although the Japanese star has just signed his new deal with Real Sociedad, his release clause still stands at €60m and anyone could trigger it.Do you see Imanol Alguacil manage Barca in the near future? You may bet on it to happen here"
Barca's biggest weakness in Betis win shown – it almost cost them points,https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-22-barcas-biggest-weakness-in-betis-win-shown-it-almost-cost-them-points/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-01-22T09:11:24.000Z,"Barcelona seemed destined for an easy win against Real Betis on Sunday when Ferran Torres grabbed a brace inside the first 48 minutes of the game. But things turned quickly in the next 20 minutes as Barca conceded twice in three minutes to set up a pulsating finish to the game. Barcelona showed signs of defensive weakness as early as the 4th minute when their high line was exposed by a sublime Isco pass for Luis Enrique. This would be Barca's biggest undoing all game, and it nearly cost Xavi's men some precious points. Isco unlocks Enrique here way too easilyFortunately for Barca, Enrique puts his attempted lob over the barIsco would score in the 56th minute via a half-volley but it was his second goal three minutes later that explains why Barcelona are struggling to keep clean sheets. One through ball unravels Barca's high line again and Isco has the simplest of touches to beat Inaki Pena. Inaki Pena found himself in no man's land on this occasion and was easily beaten. Barca's goalie looked unsure of himself throughout the game. Notice he was also guilty of punching the ball straight to Isco for Betis' first goal?He wasn't even challenged by a Betis player when he made the error.In the end, Pena once again failed to keep a clean sheet. He's only managed one clean sheet in La Liga since Ter Stegen got injured. Barca's defence have been questionable all season but it's not hard to tell they could be doing better with a more experienced goalie between the sticks. Ter Stegen won't be back till mid-February, sadly. Here's a lineup that highlights Barca's weak spots in their win against Betis:It must be noted that Barcelona's attack was breathtaking on the night with Ferran Torres netting a hat-trick. Although Lewandowski didn't really impress, everyone else around him stepped up to bury Betis. Lamine Yamal's brilliance has already been well-documented while Joao Felix came off the bench to score a sublime goal. Barca's superior attacking force is exactly why they came away from Betis with all three points. But their defense again left a lot to be desired.

He caused that equalizer by making a darting run into the box before his effort struck Gabriel Magalhaes for an own goal.He troubled the Gunners with a few sharp shot attempts and worked his socks off, but wasn’t really complimented by his teammates.Alexis Mac Allister also excelled in that no.6 role in a chaotic game. He created two goal-scoring chances, managed a 90% passing accuracy as well as contributed heavily defensively – winning 9/12 duels and making two tackles.These two are likely to continue retaining their places in the starting XI for games to come, but Klopp will hope the other players raise their performance levels going forward.Thiago return & more: 3 Liverpool positives in Arsenal defeat"

After playing for Al Ittihad in their 5-2 defeat to Al Nassr and even scoring, Big Benz reportedly went AWOL. The striker is said to be regretting ever taking the money and moving to Saudi Arabia even though his contract would've allowed him to stay at Real Madrid until the summer of 2024. According to Marca's Jose Felix, Benzema wants a return to Europe with multiple top teams already showing an interest, but Real Madrid are not one of those clubs. It was made crystal to Benzema that his time as a Real Madrid player was over when he signed the papers and moved to Saudi Arabia. Nacho has since replaced him as captain. The January transfer window will allow Benzema to find a new club in Europe either on loan or permanently. Some big stars who moved to Saudi for the bag like Benzema are already tracing their steps back to Europe. One example is former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson who joined Al Ettiffaq last summer but is now back to Europe to play for Ajax barely six months later.

Liverpool are among the 12 clubs that approved for these new rules.This would mean that there are now stricter laws over how a club can engage in sponsorship agreements or transfers with parties close to their owners.As per Sky News: “The so-called associated-party transaction (APT) rules are intended to ensure a level playing field among English football's elite teams by preventing clubs from signing commercial deals at inflated prices, thereby enabling them to spend even greater sums on players.”This comes after Newcastle United secured a massive £25m-a-year shirt sponsorship deal from Sela, a Saudi Arabia events company.Man City have been threatening legal action to the Premier League after these new rules were agreed upon as it could hamper their ability to sign winger Savio from sister club Girona in the summer.The Cityzens have reportedly agreed a deal to sign Savio, but it’s still not certain the fee they will pay to his parent club FC Troyes – who have loaned him to the La Liga club.However, Man City could face difficulties in engaging in further legal action with the Premier League as they are already caught up in a legal case concerning their alleged 115 financial breaches.1 year since Man City got charged by Premier League — why they haven't been punished yet'From docked points to stripped titles': Journalist explains what Man City's financial breaches could lead to"

However, the former Man United player claims it won't be the only change as he expects the triangle of appointments at the club.Quoted by Sky Sports, Neville said: ""It's a big job to be CEO of Man Utd, when you think of all the things he has to go at. But there are also some pretty easy wins straight away. ""Communication I think is really important, to have that voice that the club haven't had for the last 10 years. He can form part of a new management structure that can build trust with the fans, us and everybody that watches the club.""""They've not had someone who has operated in football for a long time, and that's really important. but it's a big task, and all eyes are going to be on him. He's obviously had a brilliant, amazing grounding at Man City and Barcelona, two of the most successful clubs of the last 15 years.""""It looks like Man Utd are making more sound decisions and are on the right track and that can only be a positive. Sir Jim Ratcliffe was not going to come in and not disrupt things. The disruption has started pretty quickly.""""It was obvious. They hadn't got a CEO, because Richard Arnold stepped down. They haven't got a sporting director, and they haven't got a notable head of recruitment.

Football Etiquette: Dos and Don'ts for Football Fans Attending Matches,https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-02-08-football-etiquette-dos-and-donts-for-football-fans-attending-matches/,Alex,,2024-02-08T10:35:33.000Z,"You've secured your tickets, and the anticipation for an exhilarating match day is building. As you gear up for the big event, it's essential to be aware of the dos and don'ts that can shape your experience and that of those around you.This guide will steer you through the nuances of good match day etiquette, ensuring that your presence contributes to the vibrant and positive atmosphere every football fan seeks. So, whether you're a seasoned supporter or a first-timer, let's dive straight into the key considerations that will make your match day memorable and enjoyable for all.Dos for Football FansIt’s our collective responsibility to make sure every football match is enjoyable for all of those involved. Here are some things you should do on and before the big day.Arrive Early and Be PreparedTo ensure the day goes smoothly, make sure you allow adequate travel time and arrive at the match early. This will allow you to soak in the pre-game excitement, find your seat without trouble, and contribute to a smoother flow of the crowd. Be prepared by packing essentials like tickets, identification, and any other items you need for the day. Above all, arrive with a smile, and enjoy your time in the stadium.Respect Seating AssignmentsRespecting seating assignments is another fundamental aspect of a positive match day experience. Remaining in your designated seat and avoiding seat changes helps prevent confusion and potential conflicts, allowing everyone to fully relish the game. It's a simple yet crucial gesture that showcases consideration for fellow fans and maintains the integrity of the seating arrangement.Support Your Team ResponsiblyCheering your team on adds to the whole atmosphere in the stadium, but doing so responsibly is key to maintaining a positive atmosphere. Cheer passionately, wave your team colours, and engage in chants that uplift without resorting to offensive language or gestures. You should avoid taunting rival fans and focus on celebrating your team's achievements rather than the opposing team's downfalls. Follow Stadium Rules and RegulationsAdhering to stadium rules will keep you out of trouble and ensure everyone has a pleasant match day. Before you go, familiarise yourself with prohibited items, smoking areas, and emergency procedures. Follow entry and exit protocols, as these will contribute to efficient flow of the crowd. Handle Tickets ResponsiblyKeep hold of your tickets and treat them as valuable assets! Avoid bending or tearing them, and make sure they're not exposed to adverse conditions such as rain. A well-looked-after ticket guarantees you entry to the match and prevents any last-minute complications.Once you've reached the stadium, be mindful of the specified entry gates and access points on the ticket — this will save you time and hassle, preventing you from ending up at the wrong gate.Purchase Tickets Through Authorised SourcesAlways buy your Premier League tickets and other football tickets through authorised sources to guarantee a legitimate and secure purchase. Buying from reputable outlets or the official website ensures authenticity, reducing the risk of scams or counterfeit tickets. You'll also be contributing to a fair and regulated ticketing system, promoting authentic ticket providers.Don’ts for Football FansAmongst the excitement of the game, there are a few things you should always avoid in order to maintain a positive atmosphere for everyone: Excessive DrinkingIndulging in excessive alcohol consumption not only poses risks to your own well-being but can also lead to disruptive behaviour that affects those around you. It's crucial to drink responsibly, allowing everyone to partake in the match day festivities without any negative incidents.Offensive BehaviourSportsmanship is a cornerstone of the football experience. Avoid engaging in offensive language, gestures, or taunts directed at players, officials, or fellow fans. Respecting the diverse fan base contributes to an inclusive and enjoyable atmosphere for everyone present.Unauthorised AccessStadiums have designated areas for a reason, and attempting unauthorised access can lead to disruptions and security concerns — which could potentially disrupt the entire match. It's important to respect the rules and guidelines set by the venue, ensuring a secure and organised environment for all attendees.Excessive NoiseWhile passionate support is encouraged, it's essential to be mindful of the noise level. Excessive shouting or disruptive behaviour can detract from the overall enjoyment of the game for fellow fans. Striking a balance allows everyone to revel in the excitement without unnecessary disturbances.Violence or Aggressive BehaviourIt goes without saying that violence and aggressive behaviour has no place in our football stadiums. Any form of aggressive behaviour is strictly prohibited, and a zero-tolerance policy is in effect. If you witness or experience such incidents, you should always report them to security so the matter can be dealt with. Misuse of TicketsMisuse of tickets is a serious violation of football match etiquette and can have consequences for both individuals and the overall fan experience. Avoid and report any fraudulent activities and unauthorised transferring or selling or tickets. You should also be aware that the consequences for misuse of tickets can result in legal action and bans from future events. ConclusionIn the world of football, good ticketing etiquette is the key to an enjoyable match day experience. It's not just about having a piece of paper that grants you access; it's about creating a positive atmosphere for everyone. Respecting your assigned seating, arriving early, and supporting your team with enthusiasm while being mindful of fellow fans are the building blocks of good match day etiquette."

The midfielder is keenly awaiting news from his agents about his future with Barca among his options, including the likes of Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Newcastle. Barca have reportedly been informed of the Englishman's availability on loan but their financial situation and Manchester City demands make the transfer pretty difficult to sail through. The Blaugrana would be ready to cover the player's salary only if Man City allows him to leave for free for six months. The Cityzens agreed to a similar arrangement when Barca took Joao Cancelo last summer. But in the case of Phillips, the European Champions are asking for a fee. How much will Kalvin Phillips cost Barca?Reports around Barca say Xavi is serious about signing a midfielder this January to beef up his squad but the gaffer also understands the club's dire economic condition.Phillips is heralded as a quality player having shone at Leeds where he was teammates with Barca's Raphinha before moving to Man City in 2022. However, Phillip's time at City has been a nightmare with the 28-year-old glued to the bench. He's played just 10 games this season and has been left as an unused substitute in City's last nine league games."

I think we'll be remembered forever because of how we won,"" Puyol said in a BBC documentary. ""I think everyone who has been trained by him is very lucky.""You see a team...if you held a match and took away the strips, you could tell which team was Pep's because they have a certain playing style, a method and you can spot them easily,"" Puyol concludes.

But it was a chance to get away from England and the media I was going to get.""I was aware the clock was ticking. I came very close to moving. We were having conversations. I was going to a great club, a massive club. But in the end I couldn’t go. If I’m in Germany and this happens, Annie leaves and I’m now in Germany on my own.""My kids wouldn’t be around the corner where I can see them. There’s pain and emotion at the moment but I can go to the house, take the kids to school, and my little lad to football.""Walker recently separated with his wife Annie Kilner after being caught having an affair with British TV star Lauryn Goodman. The Englishman has also apologized to Kilner, saying: ""What I've done is horrible and I take full responsibility.""I made idiot choices and idiot decisions. I can't begin to think or imagine what Annie is going through. I've tried to ask her but there's pain and hurt. My actions have caused a lot of pain to a lot of people. I'm sorry because, as a family, this isn't meant to happen.""Walker won the European Treble with Man City last season and despite his strong links to a possible move to Bayern last summer, the England international has made 29 appearances for the Cityzens in the 2023/24 season so far."
"Brahim – 8, Nacho – 2: Rating Real Madrid players in Atleti draw",https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-04-brahim-8-nacho-2-rating-real-madrid-players-in-atleti-draw/,Kingsley_,Tribuna.com,2024-02-04T22:00:00.000Z,"Brahim – 8The Spaniard did not even know he would start the game until Vinicius pulled up with an injury. But he was brilliant with his goal in the first half and could've easily scored again in the second period. One wonders why Ancelotti decided to take him off. Bellingham – 8The midfielder was extra hard for Real Madrid in today's game. He was winning duels and making all the vital tackles. Jude was so difficult to play against and Real Madrid managed to concede when Ancelotti decided to sub him off for Ceballos. Valverde – 7.5Another impressive performance from Fede today full of energy and determination. He could've scored his second goal of the season if he was any luckier. Unfortunately a big performance like his today wasn't capped off with a win for Los Blancos.Carvajal – 6Playing at centre-back seemed to be working for Dani until the final seconds of the game when his low centre of gravity was exposed by Atleti for the equalizer. Carvajal played fairly well but his height was a big disadvantage for Los Blancos today. Lunin – 6.5The Ukrainian goalie has sealed his place as Madrid's first-choice goalie but he was undone at the death by a sheer piece of lacklustre defending from the men in front of him. Lunin deserved a clean sheet today after making all those stunning saves. Other players: Mendy – 7, Vazquez – 7, Camavinga - 7.5, Kroos - 7.5, Rodrygo – 5, Nacho – 2, Joselu –  5, Modric – 6, Ceballos – 0"

He hasn't missed any Champions League matches either. His injury will be a major headache for Mikel Arteta who is already short of options in midfield.  Gabriel - 9.5, Saka - 6: Rating Arsenal players in Crystal Palace winArsenal – Crystal Palace 5:0 (2:0, 3:0)20 January, 12:30, Emirates StadiumStatisticsLineupsTableAll matchesArsenal: Raya, Zinchenko, dos Santos Magalhães (Kiwior 81), Saliba, White, Havertz (Smith Rowe 69), Rice (Jorginho 73), Odegaard, Trossard (Martinelli 69), de Jesus (Nketiah 81), SakaCrystal Palace: Henderson, Guehi (Tomkins 87), Andersen, Richards, Mitchell, Hughes (Ozoh 68), Lerma, Clyne (Ahamada 76), Eze, Mateta, Schlupp (França de Oliveira 76)Goals: 1:0 - 11  dos Santos Magalhães (Rice), 2:0 - 37  dos Santos Magalhães (Saka), 3:0 - 59  Trossard (de Jesus), 4:0 - 90+4  Martinelli (Nketiah), 5:0 - 90+5  Martinelli (Jorginho)BOOMERANG.BETN1BETMEGAPARIPARIPESATIPICO888 STAKE BOOMERANG.BETPIN UPPOKERSTARSSportsbooksCasinoBest bookmakersLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...All bookmakers"
